<p>The woman&#8217;s body is already preparing for the menopause in the mid-thirties. Most women take an average of 12 pounds and their waistline will increase by a few inches during menopause. So when we think of the belly fat of the menopause, we think negatively, because that makes us uncomfortable. The fat of menopause is the reason why the woman&#8217;s body shape changes from &#8220;pear&#8221; to &#8220;apple&#8221; and makes weight loss more difficult.</p>
<p>But everything about the menopause is not bad. In fact, menopausal fat helps women through menopause with less serious health problems by regulating estrogen production, which decreases during menopause.</p>
<p>Estrogens, called &#8220;female hormones&#8221; produced by the ovaries, as well as progesterone,  regulate the changes that occur each month and prepare the uterus for pregnancy. Before women go into menopause, the ovaries produce more than 90% of the estrogen.</p>
<p>Women&#8217;s fat cells can also produce estrogen, but not so much. Therefore, overweight women who have more fat cells have less hot flashes and osteoporosis problems during menopause.</p>
<p>The second most important female hormone is progesterone and like estrogen, it is mainly the ovaries. During menopause, when women start losing estrogen and progesterone, the woman&#8217;s fat cells try to compensate for it through development. The more fat cells grow, the more they can produce estrogen. However, this means an increase in menopausal abdominal fat as well as an increase in belly fat or waistline. Therefore, any muscle breakdown leads to weight gain during menopause and an even greater accumulation of fat during menopause.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h4>Why is it difficult to lose belly fat after 30?</h4>
<p>I think you already have a picture.</p>
<p>The belly fat of menopause produced by the fat cells of the woman&#8217;s body is her weapon against estrogen loss. The lack of estrogen worsens the symptoms of menopause. In addition, lower estrogen interferes with the normal effect of leptin (a protein hormone), which controls the appetite. Lower estrogen, therefore, means a higher appetite to burn more calories and to treat more belly fat. The reduction of testosterone is added because the metabolism slows down and burn fewer calories with less muscle mass.</p>
<p>That does not mean you have to accept menopausal fat. On the contrary, you have to fight it because fat increases the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, breast cancer, diabetes and the level of &#8220;bad&#8221; cholesterol.</p>
<h4>The most important contributors to belly fat include:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Hormones:</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, one of the major factors in weight gain is our hormones, which begin to change in the mid-&#8217;30s and &#8217;40s: this hormone change, less estrogen in women and less testosterone in men causes fat to move from our body to the middle of the body while leaving behind other areas of the body that are least of interest to you. This is one of the reasons why you can get a bit softer in the middle, while other parts of you get smaller. You can also read my previous article<a href="https://lanaturolistica.blog/2019/03/10-major-reasons-why-you-are-not-losing-weight-and-keeping-it-off-hormone-and-gut-connection-explained/"> (10 Major Reasons Why You Are Not Losing Weight and Keeping It Off: Hormone and Gut Connection Explained)</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Hereditary:</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Scientists have discovered the specific genes that determine the number and location of fat cell storage. It&#8217;s something we cannot really change, and when you look at your parents and loved ones, you see areas where your family tends to store excess fat.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Low metabolism:</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Low metabolism occurs after the age of 40 years. First, the basal metabolic rate decreases, and second, you consume less energy during exercise. Some experts say that metabolism decreases by about 5% every 40 years or after 40 years, which means that you will need about 60 to 100 fewer calories every 10 years. As you sit longer, eat more, move less, and be more stressful over the decade, you&#8217;ll probably need fewer calories. Add to that the fact that during exercise you burn fewer calories and get a weight gain equation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Muscle loss:</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Like our metabolisms, we also begin to achieve lean muscle mass in the middle age and experience a steady decline every decade. In part, scientists believe that the motor units that make up our muscles decrease with age and that these motor units do not always work with the same regularity. The important conclusion, however, is that the main factor in muscle loss is the lack of physical activity, making exercise a crucial part of preventing muscle loss.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>A byproduct of another health problem</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes you have belly fat, not because you over-eat or have a lethargic lifestyle, but because you have a medical problem that makes you fat. Depression, for example, cannot only make people weak and thin but also make people fat. Poor thyroid health as well as high Low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the bad cholesterol can also contribute to the weight issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Environmental factors</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Few of us know that pesticides, herbicides and chemical fertilizers used in agricultural products contain xenoestrogens, chemicals that are also widely used in the food and cosmetics industries. For example, xenoestrogens are released into the air, into water (because they are released on farms) and agricultural products, and enter our bodies. These chemicals contain estrogen, which interferes with the hormonal balance of both men and women and stimulates gastric fat storage and various other serious health problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Bad eating habits and poor lifestyle</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a popular cause of general belly fat. We have no control over our salivary glands. They get wild while we mostly watch delicious delicacies like biscuits, chips, candies, donuts, cakes, pastries, pasta and much more. Alcohol is another major cause of increased belly fat. Since alcohol is liquid, it can be taken in large quantities like water. It contains unnecessary calories that are normally stored in the stomach and become fat.</p>
<h4>How to fight belly fat?</h4>

<p>Women, especially in their thirties, can necessarily learn to lose belly fat because it affects how they look and how they feel about themselves. The problem is that women today are more likely to develop fat in their abdominal area if they have higher demands on work, childcare, and daily stress. All these daily activities leave little or no time for exercise. This can cause a woman to have fat around her stomach to feel depressed and try to figure out how to lose her belly fat quickly and permanently.</p>
<p>As mentioned above hormones can be your worst enemy. One of the most offensive hormones that increase belly fat beside a decline in estrogen and poor thyroid is cortisol.</p>
<h4>What is cortisol?</h4>
<p>Cortisol is known as a steroid hormone that is produced by the adrenal gland. It is released in response to high levels of stress and low blood glucocorticoids. This means that your body produces cortisol, which allows you to store belly fat. Cortisol is also produced by physical stress. In fact, high levels of cortisol production have been associated with over-training and muscle weakness during exercise, which adversely affects abdominal fat loss.</p>
<h4>What triggers high cortisol?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Excessive stress</li>
<li>Poor diet</li>
<li>Sedentary lifestyle</li>
<li>Lack of sleep</li>
<li>During Excessive endurance exercise</li>
<li>Excessive exposure to fluorescent light</li>
<li>Other health condition such as high cholesterol</li>
</ul>
<h4>So how do you combat cortisol production and other culprits to lose belly fat?</h4>
<h4> Change your lifestyle!</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<h4>Diet</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Get enough protein</strong></p>
<p>Protein is the cornerstone of muscle, and as muscle mass decreases with age, depending on your weight and age you need to increase intake. Experts recommend having protein with every meal. These healthy sources that can help reduce belly fats include fish, eggs, poultry, and lean meats. Nowadays, busy individuals use protein powders to meet their daily requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid refined carbohydrates</strong></p>
<p>Make sure you only adhere to whole grains such as Basmati, brown or wild rice, or quinoa, which release glucose more slowly, resulting in weight loss. Stay away from refined, processed, alcohol, tobacco, and unhealthy fats. Eat well by adding more low-calorie fruits, more greens, and balance your macronutrients.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Sleep well</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have trouble sleeping have a chamomile tea sweeten with raw honey. If you still have trouble sleeping it is best to see your medical doctor to find out the reality behind your sleep problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Manage your stress</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Stress is a part of our daily life. It can become a little too much. Learn to balance your life by practicing a meditation technique and getting enough rest.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Keep yourself hydrated</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our body is mainly water. Water feeds our cells and tissue. Proper hydration is important for weight loss, burning fat, increased energy and help with the digestive system.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Proper guidance</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Find a nutritionist or a health coach who knows about clean eating and exercise.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Be active</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Get involved in your community or do something that can keep you active that you feel passionate about.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Exercise</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is done through short, intense workouts with a specific exercise program that helps counteract the effects of cortisol. The effect of muscle wasting and fat storage in the stomach, based on cortisol.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Invest in your health</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a woman who wants to reduce belly fat, one of the most common supplements is products that aim to improve your health and energy levels. These supplements usually consist of vitamins and Minerals which impact positively on women&#8217;s health and a number of amino acids that are considered essential to the physical and mental well-being of women.</p>
<h4>The right supplements to help build muscle and reduce belly fat</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Omega 3 (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3PLxmlspM0&amp;t=327s">1</a>)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The omega 3 also called alpha linoleic acid help to improve athletic performance, increased energy, and basal metabolic rate. It shortens the recovery time that muscles need following intensive exercise. It facilitates the conversion of many vitamins such as vitamin C, B complex vitamins and magnesium needed to reduce cortisol level and decrease belly fat. As it helps to lower the bad cholesterol (LDL) so it can definitely reduce the risk of many other health issues.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3PLxmlspM0&amp;t=321s"> My video about the Omega&#8217;s</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BCAA&#8217;s</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In his article <a href="https://hvmn.com/blog/training/muscle-recovery-essential-to-your-next-workout">&#8220;Muscle Recovery: Essential to Your Next Workout&#8221;</a>, the author <span lang="zxx">Nate Martin from <a href="https://hvmn.com/blog">HVMN</a></span> says: &#8220;If someone doesn’t consume enough protein, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) can be a useful supplement. Amino acids are the building blocks of protein. During exercise, the body breaks down protein into amino acids; those are absorbed and transported through the body to create new proteins that encourage building muscle. BCAAs help enhance muscle protein recovery by introducing more amino acids into the body. They preserve muscle glycogen stores, which fuel the muscles and minimize protein breakdown. Studies show BCAAs as effective for muscle recovery (as well as immune system regulation)&#8221;. This article was originally published at <a href="https://hvmn.com/blog">HVMN </a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>L- carnitine</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Research suggests taken L carnitine to help with cardiovascular function reduces the accumulation of Lactic Acid during Exercise, and help with muscle growth and pain.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conjugated Linoleic Acid</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Also called CLA can help facilitate muscle growth due to anabolic properties and inhibits muscle loss or catabolism.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Green tea</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Not only it helps to suppress appetite due to Epigallo-Catechin-Gallate (EGCG) of green tea but it can be beneficial to reduce belly fat and help with weight loss.</p>
<h4>Last Thought</h4>
<p>To reduce belly fat you have to be persistent but the right way. The best thing to do is to eat well, do prolonged exercise making sure to rest the body parts. It is important to drink enough water. Find out about any underlying health issue that might be contributing to belly fat. Once in a while take a break and meditate.</p>
