Without enough amino acids, the body cannot repair or build muscle; and repairing muscle damage caused by exercise can be slow or impossible. The two types of protein that come into mind are Whey and vegetarian proteins. But how to know which one will benefit you.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h4>About Whey Protein</h4>
<p>Whey was traditionally considered waste and was thrown onto the fields and into the nearest lake. Fortunately, it has been discovered that whey contains high-quality protein. Therefore methods have been developed to remove as much of the protein as possible. The originally developed methods included acid treatment and high-temperature drying. Unfortunately, this destroyed much of the protein and compromised the quality of the extracted protein.</p>
<h4>The types of Whey:</h4>
<h4>Whey protein isolate</h4>
<p>Isolate is a form of whey in which impurities such as fat and lactose are separated from the powder during the treatment process. Therefore, it is purified or &#8220;isolated&#8221; whey. The result is a protein powder with an exceptionally high protein content (usually 80-90%) that digests quickly. It is ideal for building muscle and rapidly raising the level of nitrogen in the blood. Whey isolate is the best source of whey due to product purity and ultra-fast absorption time. It  can be used in the morning or just before or after exercise.</p>
<h4>Concentrate</h4>
<p>This protein content is generally slightly lower than that of whey isolates (usually 70 to 80%), but it can certainly be used by athletes. Whey concentrate is a perfect &#8220;complete&#8221; protein because it digests fairly quickly (about an hour to three hours). However, not so fast that you need to take several servings to feel full. Whey concentrate is the best whey powder you can take during the day or a few hours before your next meal.</p>
<h4>Hydrolyzed whey protein</h4>
<p>It is the purest protein form on the market today; and the fastest absorbed full-spectrum protein powder. The protein fractions in the whey isolate are pre-digested &#8211; which means there are additives in the course of the treatment that further dissolve the amino acid bonds, which quickly increases the digestive rate! Hydrolyzed whey protein normally contains more than 90% protein, which means you need fewer servings to get the same amount of protein in your bloodstream. You can expect hydrolyzed whey protein to be digested within an hour; making it the best whey source for your workout. However, it is not an excellent protein that you should take during training. As the high absorption rate means you are always hungry.</p>
<h4>Facts about whey protein</h4>
<ol>
<li>It comes from goat&#8217;s or cow&#8217;s milk, which contains 80% casein and 20% whey. Although casein is a protein, whey is considered the cream of the crop protein.</li>
<li>Whey is now considered a by-product of cheese making and is the purest form of protein. It contains neither fat nor lactose and contains all the essential amino acids we need. It is also a source of &#8220;natural branched-chain amino acids&#8221;.</li>
<li>It promotes weight loss by helping us feel full first, but above all by helping the body burn fat. It is nutritionally complete and easily absorbed by the body. It contains bioactive ingredients like lactoferrin, which strengthen your immune system. This protein is also known for its ability to help athletes repair and rebuild their muscles after intense training.</li>
<li>It is tasteless, so it does not change the food to which it is added. It will not cause any hormonal effects as it does not contain isoflavones. All these factors make it one of the best foods for burning fat and a great way to burn calories.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Here is the list of benefits of whey protein:</h4>
<p><figure id="attachment_1982" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1982" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1982 size-large" src="https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/scott-webb-xwMlVSqP20U-unsplash-1024x680.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="680" srcset="https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/scott-webb-xwMlVSqP20U-unsplash-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/scott-webb-xwMlVSqP20U-unsplash-300x199.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/scott-webb-xwMlVSqP20U-unsplash-768x510.jpg 768w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/scott-webb-xwMlVSqP20U-unsplash-391x260.jpg 391w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1982" class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Scott Webb on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>
<ul>
<li>In order to make fat burning more efficient, it is necessary to change our lifestyle; and include a healthy diet related to physical activity. This protein can complement a diet; while contributing to weight control by supporting metabolic control. An active metabolism helps to burn fat.</li>
<li>Whey protein is easily digested and naturally burns fat as a supplement to exercise by burning calories. It also helps slim down muscle mass and tissue without the risk of swelling, as women lack hormones that form bulky muscles. Instead, a woman begins to strengthen herself, and the <a href="https://lanaturolistica.blog/2019/05/why-women-in-their-30s-and-early-40s-cant-lose-belly-fat-how-to-fight-belly-fat/">belly fat</a> begins to disappear.</li>
<li>Healthy Aging &#8211; As you age, muscle atrophy and its detrimental effects become more important. Insurance rates are higher due to higher injury and fracture claims, and medical costs have almost gone up. Good nutrition and adequate amounts of high-quality whey protein can help strengthen muscles and bones as women age, especially when combined with exercise and strength training. A lack of adequate protein intake in old age can actually lead to a loss of bone density, especially in the hips and spine.</li>
<li>Wound healing &#8211; Not to mention that women have more reasons to undergo surgery than men. Sometimes women deliver babies by cesarean section, which leads to cuts and the need for wound healing. Most women also encounter other reproductive problems that can lead to surgery or the like. However, without the addition of sufficient amounts of high-quality whey protein (and its essential components for amino acid formation) for the repair and production of new skins and tissues, our body does not (could and could not) be identical. In fact, the healing process is delayed when the available protein levels are of inadequate quality.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Whey protein has many health benefits, including:</h4>
<ul>
<li>immune support,</li>
<li>bone health,</li>
<li>weight management,</li>
<li>metabolic stimulation,</li>
<li>fat loss,</li>
<li>and lean tissue growth.</li>
</ul>
<p>All have different effects on the body, but each has its own advantage. Using a high-quality whey protein supplement in combination with a healthy lifestyle can and will strengthen the body&#8217;s defenses and strengthen you physically. To increase your chances of living longer, happier and healthier. Choosing a whey concentrate be sure to go for organic and also make sure it comes from grass-fed cows.</p>
<h4>Concentrated goat whey protein</h4>
<p>Whey powder is also derived from goat&#8217;s with a full range of essential amino acids and non-essentials, including Muscle <a href="https://hvmn.com/blog/training/muscle-recovery-essential-to-your-next-workout">Building Amino Acids (BCAA)</a>. It is very high in protein and contains lipids, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great way to lose weight and build lean muscle. Because it can ease the craving and strengthen the immune system, it is an ideal meal replacement at any time of the day.</p>
<h4>How to choose a good protein?</h4>
<p>For muscle building and post-workout results, protein is the major source. But protein is an essential nutrient that does more than your biceps. Proteins are known for the utmost foundation of almost every tissue in your body, bones, muscles, skin, and cartilage. The production of hormones and enzymes also benefits from protein. It is not surprising that protein is such a hot topic in terms of health and well-being, especially for post-workout recovery.</p>
<p>However, choosing the right protein can be confusing based on the fact that different individual with different goals. This comes to the fact that your goal could be weight loss, easy joint support or looking for a meal replacement details, listed below are some of the most popular protein powders and how to choose a good protein for your goals.</p>
<h4>Should lactose intolerant people consume whey protein?</h4>
<p><figure id="attachment_1983" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1983" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1983 size-large" src="https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/nikolai-chernichenko-S1HuosAnX-Y-unsplash-1024x905.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="905" srcset="https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/nikolai-chernichenko-S1HuosAnX-Y-unsplash-1024x905.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/nikolai-chernichenko-S1HuosAnX-Y-unsplash-300x265.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/nikolai-chernichenko-S1HuosAnX-Y-unsplash-768x679.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1983" class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Nikolai Chernichenko on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>There are two types of proteins in milk, which is known as whey and casein and these two are known to contain lactose. For people with <a href="https://lanaturolistica.blog/2018/10/5-simple-remedies-to-soothe-lactose-intolerance/">lactose intolerance</a>, it means that the consumption of whey protein can cause side effects, which includes indigestion, nausea, abdominal pain, and other side effects. The good news is that some types of whey protein contain less lactose than others which may be safe for those with lactose intolerance. It is advisable to ask your doctor before trying a whey protein.</p>
<p>Not all whey proteins do contain much lactose. Whey protein concentrates and whey protein isolates are the main types of whey protein. Whey protein concentrate normally contains less protein than the whey protein isolate; Whey protein concentrate total protein content can range between 25 and 89%. In the whey protein concentrate powder, half of the carbohydrates content comes from lactose. Whey isolate contains at least 90% protein, which has been filtered to get rid of more lactose and in return contains fewer grams of carbs.</p>
<p>Avoid whey concentrates or powders based on a mixture of isolate and concentrate if you have lactose intolerance and want to drink whey protein.</p>
<h4>Vegetable proteins</h4>
<p>Different types of vegetable proteins are available on the market, with this it is important to choose the right one. The Natural plant Protein Powder contains the essential amino acids needed to build muscle, and also what is necessary to recover from your intense workouts and support almost all the systems of your body.</p>
<p>Most vegetarians find it difficult to get a complete dose of amino acids in one place. It is, therefore, the ideal protein if you do without animal foods. Sunflower seeds combined with pea protein and pumpkin seeds can provide about 20 grams of protein in a spoon. Note that vegetable proteins are not only reserved for vegans.</p>
<h4>The role of protein and gut health</h4>
<p>The well-known fact is that the <a href="https://lanaturolistica.blog/2018/11/dont-buy-another-probiotics-supplement-before-reading-this/">gut microbe</a> metabolizes fats, carbohydrates, and proteins which in return affects the body overall health, including gene expression and immune system.</p>
<p>When food is consumed note that the enzymes in the mouth, stomach, and small intestine would break down proteins known as amino acids. Energy source derived is based on the intestinal bacteria that use amino acids that we do not use. Then, some bacteria in the large intestine ferment amino acids that produce various compounds called metabolites. These metabolites are responsible for our metabolism, our immune system, and our nervous system.</p>
<p>Recent researches carried out has shown that a high-protein and low-fiber diet can affect the protein metabolites produced by bacteria. Also, the consumption of high protein can increase the production of some harmful metabolites, on the other hand, high fiber consumption can protect against inflammation and cause a reduction in the amount of some harmful metabolites produced by bacteria.</p>
<p>It is important to note that not all fermentations of bacterial proteins have adverse effects. For example, indole, which is derived from tryptophan protein and essential amino acid, has a positive effect on the nervous system by improving neural development and protecting against multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease.</p>
<h4>The importance of whey protein for women overall health</h4>
<p>This protein is a highly safe supplement and provides about 19 grams of protein per serving. In conjunction with a good workout program, whey protein develops lean muscle. Normally, many calories are needed to build and maintain lean muscle mass. To build lean muscle and burn fat, you need enough protein. Our body rarely converts protein into fat, so this protein does not affect fat burning.</p>
<h4>Conclusion on the selection of a good protein</h4>
<p align="left">Choose unsweetened protein ideal with the least amount of ingredients, protein as the first ingredient and city NSF seal. If you decide you can go for dairy products, be sure to choose Whey Protein Isolate. With a ratio of 150 calories per 25 grams of protein would give a positive and effective result in muscle building and fat loss.</p>
