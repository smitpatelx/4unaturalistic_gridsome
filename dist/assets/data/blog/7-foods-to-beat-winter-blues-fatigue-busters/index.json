I was plagued every month by a different symptom, sometimes the cold and flu or the stomach flu. My biggest challenge though was and still is the weather. For those who were born in a warm tropical climate, it’s even tougher. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have to take care of our immune system.  The factors that contribute to this lethargic feeling are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li> past traumatic experiences, </li><li>emotional issues,  </li><li>genetics,</li><li>a poor immune system,</li><li>and a poor lifestyle habit;</li><li>as well as a lack of good fats.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, it’s fine to feel homesick for a while, but it was something else. Something, I knew had nothing to do with being homesick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I started to investigate what caused such feelings. It was around the same time that I started to study holistic health and nutrition. With dedication and patience, I found out what type of foods and supplements were able to help. I made a personalized protocol for myself and later on I started to work with family and clients. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That led me to research more and more about the subject and gained the confidence to keep helping people. I hope that some of these recommendations can work for you too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What is Winter Blues?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Winter blues are caused by many factors such as the lack of sunlight for one. Other factors contributing to winter blues are poor eating habits, low vitamins such as vitamin D. However, some might also be affected by a disorder called SAD or Seasonal Affective Disorder. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two major hormones responsible for the possible low mood are serotonin and melatonin. So, if you feel that your symptoms are getting worse, it is best to seek medical help before attempting to do things on your own.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Listed below are 7 foods that I recommend for the best winter of your life:</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>Bee Pollen&nbsp;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It increases the body’s level of hemoglobin, making it perfect for women with anemia. It protects the liver and helps prevent certain types of cancer such as lung cancer. It is high in&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>iron,&nbsp;</li><li>potassium,&nbsp;</li><li>sodium,&nbsp;</li><li>calcium,</li><li>and many other vitamins and minerals such as vitamin C,&nbsp;</li><li>zinc,&nbsp;</li><li>and magnesium, as well as RNA.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In a study, five rats were injected weekly with DNA+RNA after twelve weeks the results were remarkable (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1532-5415.1973.tb01207.x\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1</a>). Bee pollen contains more than 5,000 types of enzymes; making one of the best foods to fight the blues and increase energy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Kelp (Also known as brown seaweed.)</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It can facilitate the excretion of toxins from the body. It helps to improve hair, nails, and skin conditions, especially during winter. It stimulates the thyroid, thus increasing energy. It helps with fatigue, obesity, and hypothyroidism in people with a slow metabolism. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It contains various vitamins and minerals such as vitamin B1, B5 and B12; as well as iodine, copper, calcium, boron, sulfur, iron, potassium, and other trace minerals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Reishi Mushrooms (Also known as Ganoderma Lucidum.)</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_20190924_111524_351-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2089\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_20190924_111524_351-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_20190924_111524_351-150x150.jpg 150w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_20190924_111524_351-300x300.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_20190924_111524_351-768x768.jpg 768w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_20190924_111524_351.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This mushroom is very useful in the treatment of allergies, it suppresses the inflammation that accompanies allergies (<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2455976\">2</a>). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reishi mushrooms contain great immune-boosting substances and work as antioxidants. It alleviates fatigue, increases stamina; it also helps decrease anxiety, stress, and insomnia. It makes possible the production of DNA polymerase and interleukin 2_  a type of Interleukin manufactured by and released from the body&#8217;s Helper T-Cells. It is a Suppressor T-Cells that is low in cancer patients.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Tip:</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I use it in powder form as a coffee substitute. As it tastes great and contains low to no caffeine; if it’s mixed with Arabica coffee.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Ginger</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a very effective anti-inflammatory spice that helps with nausea, digestive upset, and gastric ulcers. It is an effective herb and spice for low energy, especially during the cold days. It might also help with menstrual cramps, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammation, and the common cold.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Codfish and Cod Liver Oil</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Both contain EPA and DHA, super-unsaturated fatty acids that can help prevent heart attack, angina, and hypertension. Furthermore, codfish and cod liver oil help with dryness and scalp inflammation. A combination of EPA, DHA, and GLA can help fight chronic fatigue syndrome (<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2270749\">3</a>).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Turmeric</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, called Curcuma longa, is attributed to so many health benefits due to curcumin. It is a powerful spice that can help decrease inflammation and pain. It also protects the gut lining from many ailments such as gastric and duodenal ulcers. It increases the body&#8217;s production of white blood cells and helps boost the immune system. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This anti-inflammatory spice can be used as a culinary spice, it can be made into a latte as well. It comes in different forms such as root, powder, tincture, or capsules.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Pumpkin Seeds</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>These seeds contain lots of vitamins and minerals such as vitamin C, B2, zinc, and phosphorus, it is incredibly rich in linoleic acid, proteins, and fiber as well. Furthermore, it can help prevent bladder and kidney stones. Due to its high zinc content, it helps with acne and hair conditions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It supports the elimination of intestinal parasites, and helps to boost the immune system and increases energy. The oil is a powerful anti-inflammatory agent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Is there a way to cope with emotional issues?&nbsp;</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>Best Ways to Cope with Emotional Issues</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Diet</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Cut back on unhealthy foods and increase anti-inflammatory foods and spices in your diet. Whole foods play a vital role in energy during winter. Increase the intake of fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lots of omega 3 from sardines and anchovy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would recommend foods high in natural vitamin D and vitamin C. Dietary sources of vitamin D are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>eggs,&nbsp;</li><li>salmon,&nbsp;</li><li>sunflower seeds,&nbsp;</li><li>and mushrooms; or you can invest in a good supplement.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also important to do a gut cleanse by eliminating food that you are possibly sensitive to. You can accomplish this through an&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/Gut-Repair-Dayana-Deschamps-ebook/dp/B07CSMFGL4/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=dayana+deschamps&amp;qid=1551823069&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1-fkmrnull\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">elimination diet.&nbsp;</a></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Alkaline Water</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Drink lots of water. It is no longer a secret that water is vital for health. Adequate water intake can help prevent kidney problems, digestive issues, and most important of all it helps increase energy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Exercise&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you are a gym-goer type of person or you prefer dancing, it’s up to you, but give your body some flexibility and movement. Furthermore, exercise can help in releasing feel-good hormones and increasing dopamine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The British Medical Journal, 1981, found out that there is reduced dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity in Alzheimer’s disease.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Creativity</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In one of my previous articles, I recommended creativity to heal the mind. Whether it’s journaling or blogging or painting, do something that inspires you. Being creative can help fight stress and boost the immune system as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Gratefulness</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Practicing gratefulness is important for the well-being of the mind and soul, it provides a sense of well-being and peace. Live in the moment and stop worrying about the future. Praying and meditation work just fine to help calm the mind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Useful Tool&nbsp;</h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/alex-holyoake-o5s84nWykL8-unsplash-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2088\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/alex-holyoake-o5s84nWykL8-unsplash-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/alex-holyoake-o5s84nWykL8-unsplash-150x150.jpg 150w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/alex-holyoake-o5s84nWykL8-unsplash-300x300.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/alex-holyoake-o5s84nWykL8-unsplash-768x768.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Photo by Alex Holyoake on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Himalayan Salt Lamp&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>They are becoming more and more popular due to their feel-good vibe. They are perfect for adults’ and kids’ rooms. They might even protect you from the negative effects of EMF (electromagnetic fields) coming from cell phone towers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Himalayan salt lamp is effective against environmental toxins in polluted areas. I usually keep one close to my working area. It calms the mind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>My Go-To Essential Oils</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Eucalyptus Oil</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfect for winter, it can help you fight nasal congestion and sinus problems. I recommend it whether you are fighting a cold or just need a breath of fresh scent. It helps clean the lungs and bronchial from mucus build-up as well. It mixes well with lemon oil.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Oregano Oil&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p> It is one of my favorites; not only for winter or for fighting the cold. It is excellent to alleviate colitis, diarrhea, gastritis; as well as allergies and bacterial, and viral infections.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, beat the winter blues and the ailments associated with it by following your gut and getting some self-help. Cheers!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>A word of Caution</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Talk to your doctor or healthcare provider before you use any supplement or herb. Some might interact with high blood pressure medications and cause side effects in people with existent liver problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Reference</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>___________________________________________________________________________________</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li> Frank, B.
