In the digestive tract, the bacteria aid in completing the digestive process. They also aid in the production of vitamins.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Types of probiotics</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There are many types of bacteria also called probiotics but most of them come in two main groups: Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Lactobacillus is the most common, and you can get it bu consuming yogurt and other fermented products. Bifidobacterium is less popular and often present in dairy products.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Benefits of probiotics</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Probiotics have many benefits in the body. Some of these benefits include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Treatment of digestive problems:</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Diarrhea is the most common digestive problem. Several reports show that probiotics come in handy in the prevention and treatment of infectious, travelers and antibiotic diarrhea.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The reports also show that certain species of Lactobacillus are highly effective in the treatment of infectious diarrhea in children. The bacteria work by keeping the digestive system in balance thus it functions optimally. Due to this diarrhea goes away.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">I have outlined some useful information on my article: </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/w%d0%b0%d1%83%d1%95-t%d0%be-stay-h%d0%b5%d0%b0lth%d1%83-wh%d1%96l%d0%b5-tr%d0%b0v%d0%b5ll%d1%96ng/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How to protect the gut while traveling. </span></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Boosting the immune system:</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">According to studies, there is a direct connection between the bacteria in the colon and the nature of the immune system. The more the probiotics you have, the more enhanced your immune system is.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When you are taking antibiotics, it&#8217;s common for the medications to wipe out intestinal bacteria thus weakening the immune system. Probiotics work together with the immune system to fight diseases.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Better oral health:</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In addition to the bacteria being in the digestive system, they are also available in large numbers in the mouth.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">According to scientists, the higher the number of the bacteria that you have in your mouth, the better the oral health that you have. When you take probiotics, you have better breath and throat infections go away. The bacteria have also been found to treat periodontal disease.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Where to find probiotics</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Probiotics exist naturally in the digestive system; they come from the foods that you eat. If you stay for a long time without eating the bacteria-rich foods or you suffer from a medical condition you will have a probiotics deficiency. If you are having a deficiency, the best way of having the bacteria back into your body is by taking foods that are rich in the bacteria.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Some of the best foods that you should take are:</span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">fermented milk,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">pickles,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and vegetables. Some of the best vegetables to take include: shredded beets and carrots.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You can buy probiotics in the form of supplements where they contain different types of bacteria strains and forms. It&#8217;s up to you to choose the best one for your needs. Many companies sell supplements and just like in other products.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">However, no two companies are the same. When buying probiotics, make sure to buy from a reputable company.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How to use probiotics</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There are many brands of probiotics in the market that you can go for but you need to be cautious when using them. While the bacteria might be safe for most people; however if you have an immunodeficiency disease or disorder you are discouraged from using them. As mentioned, there are many probiotic brands in the market. Before buying any, first, consult your doctor to recommend the best.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When making the purchase, pay close attention to the manufacturer. To be on the safe side go with products made from a responsible manufacturer as you are sure that the products are of high quality.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Experts also recommend that you avoid products with aggressive claims. For example, you should stay away from products claiming to treat, prevent or cure certain medical conditions.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How to shop for probiotics?</span></h4>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2243\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2243\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@dailynouri?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\"><img class=\"wp-image-2243 size-large\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/daily-nouri-dHPZ27-fbqE-unsplash-1-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/daily-nouri-dHPZ27-fbqE-unsplash-1-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/daily-nouri-dHPZ27-fbqE-unsplash-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/daily-nouri-dHPZ27-fbqE-unsplash-1-768x513.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2243\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@dailynouri\">Photo by Daily Nouri on Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The top five most important thing to verify:</span></h4>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Quality</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It stands for clean, safe and researched. It is a way that the company assures that the product is in good standing (Standard). In some countries, a small label will stipulate the &#8220;Manufacturing Process&#8221; or Quality Assured.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Potency</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Most probiotics have different potency. The potency is measured in CFU (colony forming units). The potency stands for how much you need for a specific condition.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Different strain</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It refers to a biological variety within a species. The most researched strain in the world is Lactobacillus.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Stability</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This means that to keep the strain certain products have to be refrigerated. Non-refrigerated ones are called shelf-stable and they are very popular for traveling.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Will they survive the journey before being destroyed by stomach acid and/ or bad bacteria?</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">To avoid such situations, some experts recommend buying enteric-coated probiotics capsules that ensure the bacteria will get safely to the small intestines without interruption.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> </span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Best Probiotic Foods</span></h4>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2156\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2156\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2156\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/jakub-kapusnak-4f4YZfDMLeU-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/jakub-kapusnak-4f4YZfDMLeU-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/jakub-kapusnak-4f4YZfDMLeU-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/jakub-kapusnak-4f4YZfDMLeU-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2156\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Jakub Kapusnak on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Probiotic foods are foods that go through an acid fermentation process before these are available for human consumption. The process is done totally or in part. Yogurt is the best probiotic food but there are other good sources of probiotics.</span></p>\n<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kefir.</span></strong></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Like yogurt, kefir is rich in probiotics; because it undergoes the same fermentation process and combines milk and animal-derived grain. Most companies use goat milk in kefir preparation. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In addition to the good lactic acid bacilli, kefir also contains antioxidants that are good for the heart. Kefir is best when it is made by an organic process. </span></p>\n<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sauerkraut.</span></strong></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sauerkraut is based on cabbage and other vegetables with a similar texture. After cultivation, food preparation is enriched not only with probiotics but also with vitamins A, B, E and C. So, people who eat them regularly say that sauerkraut also helps fight some of the symptoms of certain allergies.</span></p>\n<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Chocolate.</span></strong></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This is also a probiotic food if it is the rich and dark-colored one. Some studies show that dark chocolates have more probiotic ingredients than dairy products. However, it is only advantageous in terms of tolerance to lactose, if you do not eat too much.</span></p>\n<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The microalgae.</span></strong></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Edible seaweed is the best form of microalgae that contains probiotics. Other sources include plants that come from the sea, such as:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">chlorella,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">spirulina,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/the-anti-inflammatory-benefits-of-phytoplanktons-and-what-to-look-for/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">phytoplankton.</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">For more information about Phytoplankton click here. Apart from lactobacilli, microalgae foods are also good sources of energy.</span></p>\n<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Miso.</span></strong></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This is a favorite Japanese food that people also prefer for its medicinal properties. It is made from grains and beans; it is the main flavor in Japanese soup. As a probiotic food, Miso acts to regulate your digestive system. Miso is packed with nutrition it also helps neutralize carcinogens before they can spread.</span></p>\n<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tempeh.</span></strong></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This is exclusively made from soybeans and similarly Asian in origin. It is often used as a meat substitute, the same purpose as tofu. Vegetarians like to bake or sautée the tempeh and eat it as their alternative source of protein that meat provides.</span></p>\n<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kimchi.</span></strong></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This is Korea&#8217;s answer to the sauerkraut of Germany. Also made from cabbage, kimchi is however fermented to give it a sour and very spicy quality. If you like your food hot, kimchi is among the best probiotic foods because it is also a source of other essential nutrients such as iron, calcium and vitamins A, B1, and B2.</span></p>\n<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kombucha.</span></strong></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This one is unique because its preparation involves neither dairy nor grain but tea leaves. Thus, you drink rather than eating it. This tea becomes a probiotic agent when it is fermented. Those who drink kombucha swear that it not only prevents digestive problems but also helps them lose weight.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Final thought:</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Most experts recommend taking from 1 to 10 billion as general use for adults depending on their needs. If the person is an adult with a specific condition doctor might recommend up to 150 billion until the balance has been restored. Once the balance is restored eating healthily, consuming fermented products and take lower potency probiotics supplements is the best.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Check out my video about probiotics </span></h4>\n<p class=\"responsive-video-wrap clr\"><iframe title=\"How to Shop for Probiotics Supplements\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/F8d4P_bXlc0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Reference: </span></h4>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li>Fernandes, C.
