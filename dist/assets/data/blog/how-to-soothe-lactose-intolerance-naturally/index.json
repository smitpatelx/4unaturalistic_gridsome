For those who do not suffer from lactose intolerance, it can seem to be a terrible affliction: no ice cream; no rich, creamy foods like pasta alfredo; no buttercream icing on cupcakes.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">However, food scientists are coming up with a variety of ways for a person with lactose intolerance to lead a close-to-normal lifestyle. Trust me, I understand your pain. I joined that club a while ago. In this article, I will be talking about the type of lactose that is plaguing your life. I will also be giving tips and natural remedies that can help soothe such a problem.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lactose is the name for the particular sugar in milk or milk products. It is composed of glucose and galactose sugar molecules that must be split to be digested. In our bodies, lactase is the enzyme that does this splitting. For those with lactose intolerance, their lactase is deficient or does not function properly, whether due to genetics, problems with development, etc&#8230;</span></p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Types of Lactose deficiency</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The following are the three types of lactase deficiency;</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Primary Intolerance level (Permanent) </span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">when a society does not consume dairy products, a baby is not used to it. Babies do not drink milk; this is found in various cultures Asia and Africa, where the pre-industrialized dairy products and co-commercially options are rare.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Secondary Intolerant level acquired (Reversible/temporary)</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is a relative deficiency (Transient) of the lactase enzyme in the gut. Most people may experience nausea; however, there are many rare cases.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Congenital lactase</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is a genetic disorder in which pre-enzyme production comes from lactase. Is present at birth and the diagnosis is made in infancy. Genes determine this kind of intolerance and it is closely tied to race or ethnic people (territorial) which proceed. Therefore, there is a predisposition due to genetics, to suffer a deficiency of lactase.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Causes and symptoms of lactase deficiency</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lactose intolerance is a deficiency of the lactase enzyme that may occur due to certain factors. Primary lactose intolerance occurs in some individuals due to the aging process. When an individual is born, the body produces a large amount of lactose and throughout the childhood years when the primary source of nutrition consists of milk.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Typically the production of lactase decreases as the diet changes and contains more food varieties. This gradual decrease in the production of lactose may cause some individuals to experience the symptoms of lactose intolerance.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Secondary lactose intolerance</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It occurs when there is a decrease in the production of lactase by the small intestine due to an injury or surgical procedure. This type can also develop due to an intestinal disease such as Crohn&#8217;s disease, IBD or inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or gastroenteritis.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Congenital lactose intolerance</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is a very rare form of lactose intolerance as two of the defective genes that cause this disorder must be inherited with one being passed on from both the mother and father.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">These symptoms typically develop thirty minutes to two hours after consuming a food or beverage that contains lactose and can include nausea, diarrhea, gas, bloating, and abdominal cramps. These symptoms are typically mild in the majority of individuals; however, some individuals can experience more severe symptoms.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Overview of the symptoms of lactose deficiency</span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Abdominal pain</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Diarrhea</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Passing gas</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bloating/distention</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Nausea</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Food to avoid if you have lactose intolerance</span></h4>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2261\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2261\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2261\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/canstockphoto30300761.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/canstockphoto30300761.jpg 800w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/canstockphoto30300761-300x200.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/canstockphoto30300761-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2261\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">karandaev</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Milk</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The main thing a lactose-intolerant individual must avoid is milk. If you are someone who loves to pour milk on your cereal or just drink milk from a glass, then, of course, you must stop! What can you do instead? Go for coconut, nuts and seeds milk, which means that there are no dairy products and no lactose.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Butter</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Butter is another ingredient that is off the cards when it comes to the true lactose intolerant. This means you can’t spread it on your toast, in which case you might want to consider using something else such as coconut butter or coconut oil – which can be just as delicious if not more so!</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Cheese</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This has to be one of the hardest foods for many lactose-intolerant individuals to pass up! Cheese is of course made from dairy and this means that it too is off the cards. This means you can’t use cheese grated on top of your food, it also means that you can’t have cream cheese or anything that has got a cheesy flavor. You can go for cashew cheese that can be an even more delicious option.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ice cream</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Another difficult one to pass up is ice cream. Ice cream is again made from dairy products – it is frozen cream! Then again, there are plenty of options you can use to get around this problem. For example, you can make hand-made gelato that will avoid using any dairy products and have more of a sweet, sorbet flavor. Nowadays, many health food stores carry coconut ice cream.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Margarine</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you thought that margarine was a safe alternative to butter then think again: often you’ll still be consuming dairy. If you are looking for something you can eat every day that will work just like butter and be spread neatly on your bread, then you can just do some research online to make sure that your alternative is lactose-free.</span></p>\n<h4>Other dairy products to avoid:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>dry milk,</li>\n<li>powdered milk,</li>\n<li>evaporated milk</li>\n<li>whey,</li>\n<li>and curd,</li>\n<li>as well as condensed milk.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Natural remedies for lactose intolerance</span></h4>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2262\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2262\" style=\"width: 989px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2262\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/eiliv-sonas-aceron-OFJ1NItf2RE-unsplash-989x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"989\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/eiliv-sonas-aceron-OFJ1NItf2RE-unsplash-989x1024.jpg 989w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/eiliv-sonas-aceron-OFJ1NItf2RE-unsplash-290x300.jpg 290w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/eiliv-sonas-aceron-OFJ1NItf2RE-unsplash-768x795.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 989px) 100vw, 989px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2262\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@shootdelicious?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Eiliv-Sonas Aceron</a> on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> </span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ginger</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ginger is one of the best natural lactose intolerance remedies for lactose-intolerant people. When the indigestion of lactose leads to bloating, ginger helps in suppressing it. Freshly grated ginger should be placed in a cup of hot water and allowed to soak for a few minutes.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Chamomile tea</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Chamomile tea has excellent properties that are anti-bloating, which help people fight abdominal pain and gas during lactose intolerance. It helps maintain the pH levels in the stomach by neutralizing the acids. Prepare the tea with dried chamomile flowers and consume it 2-3 times a day for better results.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Peppermint</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Peppermint is another great ingredient that we often use in our kitchens. It has anti-inflammatory properties that restore pain during lactose intolerance. Put some peppermint leaves in a cup of hot water and leave for a while. Drink at least twice daily to see its wonderful result.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Fennel seeds</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Chewing fennel seeds after a meal helps maintain a healthy digestive process. It controls lactose intolerance to a great extent when it is consumed directly or boiled with water to make a tea.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lemon juice</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lemon juice helps relieve stomach pain due to lactose intolerance. You can turn lemon into a tasty drink by adding it to water. This drink can be taken twice or three times a day to avoid bloating and stomach aches.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Final thought</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There are a lot of dairy alternatives that are delicious and nutritious such as:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">nut and seed milk and products,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">soy milk and products,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">potato milk,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and coconut milk and products</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">I this article I outlined a lot of information about dairy alternatives that people can use to bake, cook and consume. </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1 class=\"single-post-title entry-title\"><a href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/how-to-live-lactose-free-by-using-delicious-alternatives/\">How to Live Lactose-Free by Using Delicious Alternatives</a>.</h1>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">However, with all that said don&#8217;t forget to increase the nutrient that you might be missing such as:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">calcium,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">magnesium,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and zinc</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">as well as vitamin D and K to support teeth and bones, and overall health; by preventing other conditions such as osteoporosis. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is best to carry a lactose digestive enzyme that can be taken in occasional &#8220;dine-out&#8221; situations where dairy products cannot be avoided.</span></p>\n<h4>Reference:</h4>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532285/</li>\n<li>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK310263/</li>\n<li>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4923703/</li>\n<li>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6341159/</li>\n<li>https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2015/ss/relief-from-common-digestive-distress</li>\n<li>https://draxe.com/health/symptoms-of-lactose-intolerance/</li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>Lactose intolerance is an increasingly diagnosed characteristic of people with chronic stomach ailments.
