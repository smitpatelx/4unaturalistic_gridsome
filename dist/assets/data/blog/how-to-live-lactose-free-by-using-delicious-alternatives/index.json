In my previous article </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://lanaturolistica.blog/2018/10/natural-remedies-to-soothe-lactose-intolerance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">“Natural Remedies To Soothe lactose Intolerance”</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> I mentioned how difficult it is for people with this condition as most foods contain some sort of dairy products high in lactose.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In this new article, I will provide some safe and tasty lactose-free alternatives to help people whether they have lactose intolerance or not.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">About lactose</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lactose the main sugar in dairy and milk products is found in large quantities in yogurt, ice cream, cheeses, and butter. Lactose is digested in the small intestine by an enzyme called lactase that decreases as we age. As we consume dairy products, the lack of lactase causes many digestive issues. Fortunately, many alternatives are available at our local shop or health food stores. That can help us lead a healthy life while conserving our taste buds.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There is nothing wrong with being different. Whether they are better or worse depends on what you expect from these different choices.</span></p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Some of the best option to keep in mind:</span></h4>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2255\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2255\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2255\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/neonbrand-SvhXD3kPSTY-unsplash-1024x529.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"529\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/neonbrand-SvhXD3kPSTY-unsplash-1024x529.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/neonbrand-SvhXD3kPSTY-unsplash-300x155.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/neonbrand-SvhXD3kPSTY-unsplash-768x397.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2255\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@neonbrand?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Photo by NeONBRAND on Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Coconut Milk:</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The number one milk alternative that I can think of is coconut milk. You can add it to shakes, smoothies and many awesome recipes. It is creamy with a rich taste, it is also full of healthy saturated fats.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The coconut flesh contains:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">B-vitamins,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">vitamin C,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and minerals such as iron,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">calcium,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">magnesium,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and selenium</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">as well as healthy saturated fats like medium-chain triglycerides, specifically an MCT called lauric acid.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It can make delicious Caribbean, South American and Indian recipes.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Soy Milk:</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This is the most common substitute for milk. It contains many vitamins and minerals and protein. Even it&#8217;s mineral content is a little bit lower than that of actual cow milk. It provides additional cardiac protection for phytochemicals; It is also very beneficial for women going through menopause.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Because the soymilk can be easily made at home, especially with a soymilk maker, it is actually a healthy alternative. It can even be used to make a nice, creamy, homemade yogurt. Although not usually as thick as dairy yogurt, it can be thickened by the use of agar powder, cornstarch or arrowroot.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As cornstarch is readily available then you can use it by:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Mixing 2 tsp with 30 ml. of cold water;</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and add the mixture to the soy milk just before cooking.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As I said, the taste is different so a little experimenting could be fine. For example, some suggest adding a touch of vanilla flavor to the soymilk if you are using it on cereals. Soybeans have a shelf life of 18 months, so homemade soymilk is a good candidate for your long-term food storage program. Make sure to always buy organic, Non-GMO soy milk whenever this procedure is too much and you need soymilk for your pantry.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rice Milk:</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Although you can find it in some shops, it is less common than soymilk. Fortunately, you can make it at home. Compared to cow&#8217;s milk, rice milk contains more carbohydrates but no cholesterol or lactose. It also contains no appreciable amounts of calcium or protein. You need to make sure that you get enough of these two important nutrients in another way.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rice milk is not as thick as dairy milk or soy milk and seems to be slightly translucent. It is naturally sweet and is great for dessert recipes, but less useful if that sweetness is not needed or desired. As a result, some people like it on cereals while others do not &#8211; just a matter of personal preference.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You can use rice milk to make great homemade yogurt, but the end result is very fluid; making it a yogurt drink rather than a meal you spoon out of a bowl or cup.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Oat Milk:</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Oat milk like rice milk is grain milk and has similar nutritional properties. However, there is a lack of pronounced sweetness, and some suggest adding honey as a sweetener to increase palatability, though not everyone believes it is necessary.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">However, the lack of added sweetness makes it a better candidate for use in soups and sauces and other recipes where a sugary taste is not desired. The texture is light with a very mild taste, many agree that it replaces low-fat or non-fat milk very well.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Oat milk is lactose-free, a great benefit for those who are lactose intolerant, but it does contain some gluten. A fact that has to be taken into account by those who have gluten sensitivity.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Potato Milk:</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The purpose of the potato milk is to duplicate the texture of the dairy milk, and to be surprisingly close to the taste and is increasingly recommended for those who eat wheat-free and dairy-free. Potatoes, which are among the most tolerated foods (meaning that few people have allergies or intolerances), make potato milk an ideal candidate for such applications.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Many have tried it in smoothies, on cereals and for baking with generally positive results. Although potato milk has a high carbohydrate content, it also has a high potassium content as well as many other vitamins and minerals. You can make your own products, but unfortunately, potatoes do not have the shelf life of soybeans, nuts, and rice or other grains.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">So when it comes to long-term storage programs for food, potato milk has some shortcomings in this regard.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Nut Milk:</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There is no lactose in nuts, but it may contain other allergens, so be careful of if you have a nut allergy. However, many find it very digestible and appreciate the high protein content. Nut Milk such as:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">almond;</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">cashew;</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and macadamia; have a creamy consistency that is very similar to soymilk.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The nutty taste makes them very interesting, and some would say they are a &#8220;delicious&#8221; addition to fruit smoothies and other creamy desserts and drinks. This may not be so useful in tasteless dishes, although personal preferences will also play a role here. Many reports that they generally use it in cooking very successfully.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You can use it to make delicious yogurt, although the end result is more of a yogurt drink than a creamy yogurt to spoon out of its container.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Seed Milk:</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Pumpkin seeds are high in many nutrients. They contain many vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants such as:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">B-complex,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">vitamin A, and E,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">magnesium,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">phosphorus,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">iron,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and zinc, and most of the seed&#8217;s fiber protein and some fat.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Other seeds such as sesame and sunflower seeds can be used too.

Have you ever heard of cashew cheese?</span></h4>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2254\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2254\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2254\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gaelle-marcel-epOUNXsFWQQ-unsplash-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gaelle-marcel-epOUNXsFWQQ-unsplash-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gaelle-marcel-epOUNXsFWQQ-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gaelle-marcel-epOUNXsFWQQ-unsplash-768x513.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2254\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Gaelle Marcel on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Well, it is a delicious cheese-like substitute made of soaked cashews. Cashew is a top source of vitamin E, that helps protect cells throughout the body from everyday damage. It can be bought at a local grocery store or you can absolutely make your own. It has a rich creamy taste that makes it the perfect substitute for Alfredo sauce. I use coconut cream, cashew cheese, and nutritional yeast to make a delicious macaroni and cheese. </span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Did you say “Butter”?</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Again, there is no need to panic. Get creative, forget about that old plain cow milk butter if you are sensitive or have lactose intolerance, you can mix nuts and seeds to make delightful and nutritive nut kinds of butter. Add it to your noodles, your plates of pasta, your bread, make a tartine” and so on. However, never use nut butter to cook or stir- fry for that there is coconut or grapeseed oil.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Coconut Milk Kefir:</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">For a person with lactose intolerance then Coconut milk kefir is a ray of hope as it is made up of dairy-free ingredients besides it is a good source of probiotics. It aids with digestion and helps to boost immunity. It contains many different bacteria that help to counteract lactose intolerance by its association with lactase; it helps to promote normal absorption of dietary fats; reduction of internal gas; suppression of harmful bacteria. It is available in grocery stores or health food stores, you can also make your own.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Final thought</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In brief, there is no need to live dessert free, you can have an almost lactose-free life without depriving your taste buds.
