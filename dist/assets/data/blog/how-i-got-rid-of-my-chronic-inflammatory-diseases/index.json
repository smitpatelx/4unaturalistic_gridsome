Less talk more action!</p>\n<p>Seven <span lang=\"en-US\">W</span>ays to <span lang=\"en-US\">O</span>ptimum <span lang=\"en-US\">H</span>ealth:</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h4></h4>\n<h4>1. Diet Change</h4>\n<p>I recommend starting an <a href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/living-with-chronic-pain-tips-for-your-best-life/\">anti-inflammatory diet</a><span lang=\"en-US\">, i</span>t should include fresh fruits, vegetables, healthy sprouted grains, and fats; make sure to choose your protein source wisely. It&#8217;s best to buy organic and NON-GMO foods. Otherwise, learn to shop by the &#8220;dirty dozen and cleanest fifteen lists&#8221;. It&#8217;s a list that provides information about foods that people don&#8217;t have to buy organic. Don&#8217;t forget to drink filtered alkaline water.</p>\n<p>Learn to cook with anti-inflammatory spices such as curcumin or ginger. Avoid chemical<span lang=\"en-US\">s</span> from foods, drinks, cosmetics and cleaning products as much as you can. Consume natural sources of sugar instead of the unhealthy kind.</p>\n<p>You might be asking yourself<span lang=\"en-US\"> what this has to with </span>our current topic<span lang=\"en-US\">,</span> but you have to know that if you don&#8217;t change your lifestyle your body can become overloaded with toxicity<span lang=\"en-US\">,</span> affecting both the physical and emotional aspect of your life.</p>\n<h4>2) Get <span lang=\"en-US\">B</span>etter <span lang=\"en-US\">S</span>leep</h4>\n<p>Many people have trouble sleeping because of the many factors that will be discussed promptly. First of all, your bed is made for sleeping only. The reason for that statement is because some people use their bed to eat. Unless there is a particular reason for such behavior I would advise to use any other sitting area except the bed. Next, check what you&#8217;re eating close to bedtime because it might also cause insomnia. Make sure to always check for excess light in the room. If you still have trouble sleeping<span lang=\"en-US\">,</span> the best thing to do is get a proper diagnosis to figure out whether or not you suffer from a mental condition or insomnia.</p>\n<p>Last, consider using supplements or herbs. When the body is overactive it might need a boost to help with recovery. Best herbs for mood, sleep problems<span lang=\"en-US\">,</span> and fatigue are chamomile and St. John&#8217;s Wort.</p>\n<h4>3) Try <span lang=\"en-US\">D</span>etoxing <span lang=\"en-US\">E</span>very <span lang=\"en-US\">Y</span>ear</h4>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-969 size-large\" src=\"https://lanaturolistica.blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/terra-evans-749008-unsplash-1-1024x870.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"551\" /><img class=\"wp-image-1923 size-large aligncenter\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/rawpixel-707572-unsplash-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /></p>\n<p>Detox has become a very popular word in the past few years. The same way that you need to rest when you&#8217;re sick or tire<span lang=\"en-US\">d,</span> your body needs a rest from toxic overload. If you can&#8217;t take a detox don&#8217;t force it<span lang=\"en-US\">,</span> you can detox by eating a clean anti-inflammatory diet. You can also use juicing and anti-inflammatory detoxing herbs to cleanse the liver and colon. Best herbs for a liver cleanse are milk thistle, dandelion<span lang=\"en-US\">,</span> and burdock root.

It is not a secret that a sedentary lifestyle can lead to many health conditions. Exercise is important when it comes to health. Not only <span lang=\"en-US\">does it</span> help shape your body<span lang=\"en-US\">, but it also</span> keeps your mind active and sharp. It helps control blood sugar, increase oxygen in the cells, <span lang=\"en-US\">increase the capacity of the lungs,</span> and decrease body weight. Exercise can help you release feel-good hormone<span lang=\"en-US\">s, t</span>herefore, it can help if you suffer from many emotional conditions. Now, the tricky part is that many people cannot commit to exercise<span lang=\"en-US\">,</span> so I suggest that you find a schedule, routine<span lang=\"en-US\">,</span> and activity that you enjoy.</p>\n<h4>5) Heal <span lang=\"en-US\">Y</span>our <span lang=\"en-US\">E</span>motions by <span lang=\"en-US\">I</span>nspiring <span lang=\"en-US\">O</span>thers</h4>\n<p>You can use your little imprint to help others that are close to you. Wait a minute<span lang=\"en-US\">…</span> this is exactly what I am doing right now! Find an activity that inspires you and use it to inspire others. I love writing and I use social media to post a supporting message to my readers. Someone I know love<span lang=\"en-US\">s</span> makeup and she uses her knowledge to give hope to others by giving them a free makeover that leaves them speechless and crying.</p>\n<h4>6) <span lang=\"en-US\">P</span>ractice <span lang=\"en-US\">L</span>ove</h4>\n<p>Not everyone can feel grateful and give love when things are tough. It&#8217;s not easy if one feels deeply wounded<span lang=\"en-US\">, so</span> learn to see the world differently. Someone who lost her only child to cancer told me that it took her months to come out of her depressive mood. After months of crying, grieving and feeling depressed<span lang=\"en-US\">,</span> she told me that her love for her lost son made her strong. She finally woke up and started to help others because her son would have loved to see her helping others going through the same situation. She is making a difference, that way she can work through her pain. She is giving love so she can receive love.</p>\n<h4>7) Spend a <span lang=\"en-US\">L</span>ittle <span lang=\"en-US\">T</span>ime with <span lang=\"en-US\">N</span>ature</h4>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-987 size-large\" src=\"https://lanaturolistica.blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/stephen-crowley-110327-unsplash-1024x681.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"431\" /><img class=\"wp-image-1924 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/canstockphoto56197605-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/canstockphoto56197605-1.jpg 800w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/canstockphoto56197605-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/canstockphoto56197605-1-768x513.jpg 768w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/canstockphoto56197605-1-391x260.jpg 391w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Nature is a way to feel connected to everything. It doesn&#8217;t matter what you&#8217;re going through, a walk in the woods can help you feel more alive. I usually suggest hiking, walking,<span lang=\"en-US\"> and</span> skiing to my clients, whatever makes them happy. I love driving a little further away from the place I live in. Even in winter, I enjoy the beauty of nature<span lang=\"en-US\">,</span> it never stops amazing me. I also invested in indoor plants<span lang=\"en-US\">,</span> a small fish tank; <span lang=\"en-US\">and</span> a water sound system<span lang=\"en-US\"> t</span>hat keeps me calm and brings me peace.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Love and believe in yourself. Trust your gut and do something positive today<span lang=\"en-US\">.</span>&#8220;</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I was extremely sick, suffering from different health issues ranging from anxiety and hormonal imbalance to lots of digestive issues, including a bleeding ulcer, I was tired, overweight, and depressed.
