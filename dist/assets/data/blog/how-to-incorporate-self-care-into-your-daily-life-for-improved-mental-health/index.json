Anxiety and depression are two of the most common problems. Taking the time to invest in self-care, both physically and emotionally, can help stave off such issues. Find out what you can do on a regular basis to maintain a positive outlook all year round.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h4>Get at least seven hours of sleep per night</h4>\n<p>Adults are advised to get <a href=\"https://www.beddrsleep.com/posts/are-you-getting-enough-sleep-for-your-age\">seven to nine hours</a> of sleep per night. Without sufficient rest, your brain won’t work as it should. You will find it harder to concentrate on tasks and may feel drowsy during the day. So-called <a href=\"https://www.calmclinic.com/anxiety/causes/sleep-debt\">sleep debt</a> can also contribute to anxiety. This results in a vicious cycle, as anxiety subsequently makes it harder to catch those much-needed Z’s!</p>\n<p>Create a <a href=\"https://www.thespruce.com/design-a-bedroom-for-better-sleep-350739\">bedroom atmosphere</a> that is conducive to sleep. Consider decorating it with soothing colors like pastels, and install curtains and shades to ensure darkness. The brain is programmed to respond to light by triggering you to wake up, so keeping sunlight out is a must.</p>\n<h4>Set up an area in your home for meditation<img style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #7a7a7a;\" src=\"https://lanaturolistica.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/meditation-1024x614.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"389\" /></h4>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_1963\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1963\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1963 size-large\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/jd-mason-xCPdjitY5sQ-unsplash-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/jd-mason-xCPdjitY5sQ-unsplash-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/jd-mason-xCPdjitY5sQ-unsplash-300x225.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/jd-mason-xCPdjitY5sQ-unsplash-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1963\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by JD Mason on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Your bedroom isn’t the only area to address if you want to reduce stress in your home and create a more relaxing environment. Consider creating a small corner in your house that you can use for meditation. When creating your meditation space, make it <a href=\"https://www.homeadvisor.com/r/meditation-room/\">a peaceful zone</a> with minimal distractions. This can mean a spare room, your back porch, or even a corner of a room. Choose the right amount of lighting based on your preferences. Be sure to keep the space clutter-free, and only leave out what you’ll need for meditating. You may also want to use incense or scent diffusers to enhance the atmosphere; essential oils like <a href=\"https://www.healthyandnaturalworld.com/best-essential-oils-anxiety-depression/\">lavender and chamomile</a> are known to have a calming effect.</p>\n<h4>Make exercise a part of your regular routine</h4>\n<p>Exercise helps you maintain muscle tone, balance, flexibility, and coordination. It also boosts lung capacity and gets your heart pumping, improving cardiovascular and circulatory health. In addition to these great physical effects, physical activity boosts your mood. Breaking a sweat produces <a href=\"https://www.pathway.com/blog/the-connection-between-endorphins-and-exercise/\">feel-good endorphins</a> in the brain, which make you happy.</p>\n<p>If you don’t exercise now, talk to a doctor first before undertaking any strenuous activities. Start light and work your way up to tougher workouts. To make exercise a part of your self-care routine in the long-term, you need to find activities you truly enjoy. You don&#8217;t have to settle for running on a treadmill; look into yoga, swimming, aerobics classes, cycling, or dance courses.</p>\n<h4>Embrace healthy eating in your everyday life</h4>\n<p>The food you put in your body also impacts your brain. For example, serotonin helps regulate your moods, appetite, and sleep. This neurotransmitter is primarily produced in the gastrointestinal tract. As <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/nutritional-psychiatry-your-brain-on-food-201511168626\">Harvard Health</a> explains, it&#8217;s been shown that people who take supplements containing &#8220;good&#8221; bacteria that promote gastrointestinal health also have improved mental health.</p>\n<p>So what makes for a healthy diet? <a href=\"https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/chapter-1/key-recommendations/\">Dietary guidelines</a> recommend primarily focusing on vegetables from all subgroups, fresh fruits, and whole grains. It&#8217;s also important to include lean proteins and fat-free or low-fat dairy products. If you are lactose intolerant, you can look for fortified soy, nut and seeds products instead.</p>\n<h4>Learn how to say no to other people</h4>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_1964\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1964\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1964 size-large\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/isaiah-rustad-HBABoZYH0yI-unsplash-1-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/isaiah-rustad-HBABoZYH0yI-unsplash-1-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/isaiah-rustad-HBABoZYH0yI-unsplash-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/isaiah-rustad-HBABoZYH0yI-unsplash-1-768x513.jpg 768w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/isaiah-rustad-HBABoZYH0yI-unsplash-1-391x260.jpg 391w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1964\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Isaiah Rustad on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lanaturolistica.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/isaiah-rustad-HBABoZYH0yI-unsplash-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"433\" /></p>\n<p>Your friend needs a favor, your boss has another project for you, the kids are demanding your attention—it seems like everyone in your life has something to ask of you. You simply can’t say yes to all of these things, or you will find yourself overloaded and overwhelmed by tasks. Sometimes, you simply have to say no. Doing so can be easier said than done, however.</p>\n<p>Learning how to say no can be especially difficult in the workplace. Many people think declining to take on a task or project will hurt their success, but in fact, the opposite may be true. As Forbes <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/elanagross/2016/09/19/when-to-say-no-at-work/#406a7a6e1322\">explains</a>, &#8220;saying no strategically and respectfully can help your career.&#8221; If you are uncomfortable with flat-out refusing, consider offering an alternative to their request, or you can decide to revisit that request at a later time depending on your schedule and priorities.</p>\n<h4>Set aside time to do absolutely nothing</h4>\n<p>People are programmed to stay busy. In today’s modern world, we often associate doing nothing with being lazy. However, it’s absolutely essential to recharge your batteries and protect your mental health by simply sitting still every once and awhile. When you are always on the go, your body produces cortisol, which <a href=\"https://www.selfgrowth.com/articles/the_value_of_doing_nothing\">increases stress levels</a>. Taking a break counteracts this process.</p>\n<p>As mentioned above, meditation is one way to unwind while doing nothing. Gaiam provides a <a href=\"https://www.gaiam.com/blogs/discover/meditation-101-techniques-benefits-and-a-beginner-s-how-to\">guide for beginners</a> to help you get started and lays down all the steps, from how to position yourself to how to regulate breathing. Another option is to take a bath. Run yourself a warm tub, put on some soothing tunes, light some candles, and shut out the world for a bit. You’ll find yourself relaxed, refreshed, and feeling better than ever afterward.</p>\n<h4>Be patient &amp; give these holistic approaches the time to take effect</h4>\n<p>Instead of trying to adopt each of these overall lifestyle changes for wellbeing immediately, adopt them one step at a time. Holistic approaches like increasing your hours of sleep and meditating address your health mentally and physically. They do take time to work, however. Don’t expect overnight results, or you are liable to get overwhelmed and give up in frustration. Give yourself time to adjust to the new routine.</p>\n<p>Habits that seem difficult now, like setting aside thirty minutes every day to do nothing, will start to feel normal. You might even notice that your mood takes a hit if you miss a day of exercise or a meditation session. This is exactly the point: You want the above steps to feel normal. Once you’ve achieved that, you’ll be in a great place. Best of all, once you do start to feel the benefits, you will be even more motivated to continue.</p>\n<h4 align=\"left\">Notice:</h4>\n<p lang=\"zxx\" align=\"left\">Information on this article is for educational purposes only.
