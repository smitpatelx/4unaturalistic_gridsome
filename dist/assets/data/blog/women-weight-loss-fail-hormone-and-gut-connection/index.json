We have even heard of individuals going through surgery just to get rid of the extra pound. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">However, the sad truth is, most of these tricks don&#8217;t work if the body is not receiving an adequate amount of healthy macro and micronutrients. This is why it becomes easier to gain back twice the amount of weight that they previously had. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">To lose weight and keep the extra pound off, it is best to know why it is not happening and what strategies and approaches to use. In this article, we are going to review the top 10 reasons why most people fail to lose weight and keep it off.</span></p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">10 Major Reasons Your Weight Loss Program is Failing</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> </span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">1. Gut Issues</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Anything related to the gut can affect your weight. <a href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/how-to-know-if-you-have-leaky-gut-5-essential-supplements-to-protect-the-gut-lining/\">Gut inflammation</a> and poor gut health can contribute to poor absorption of nutrients and weight gain. A Leaky gut is one of the first culprits; as well as hidden food sensitivities or allergies, constipation, and overgrowth of bad bacteria and any other digestive issues are mostly behind the problem.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">2. Poor Eating Habit</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You are probably consuming a lot of empty calories while your body is crying for actual nutrients. Such foods are refined, processed, baked goods, sodas, chips, alcohol, and fast foods. Empty calories from processed and refined foods cause weight gain and malnutrition and increase the risk of diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and stroke. </span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">3. Calorie Reduction</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Reducing too many calories at once and feeding yourself with worthless foods is not enough to maintain overall health and lose weight. A fast reduction in calories can shock your body system, making it pack on fat even if you are on a 0 calorie a day diet plan. Your body sees a fast reduction in calories at the onset of starvation. </span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">4. Hidden Hormonal Problem </span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">One of the biggest threats to our weight goal is hormonal imbalance; whether it is estrogen dominance, low progesterone, adrenal exhaustion, or insulin resistance; your body can’t be healthy if your hormones are not balanced. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Estrogen Dominance</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Healthy estrogenic hormones are responsible for the growth and development of female sexual characteristics and reproduction. However, Estrogen dominance, also called high estrogen, can occur; it might be due to insufficient production of its controllers. High estrogen can cause more fatty tissue growth and fat cells, weight gain, PMS, and water retention in younger women. Low estrogen also contributes to weight gain in menopausal women. Any change in estrogen can cause weight fluctuation. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Low Progesterone</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Low progesterone can cause fluid retention and decreases your thyroid function. The thyroid is part of the endocrine system which is made up of glands that produce, store, and releases hormones into the bloodstream so the hormones can reach the body’s cells. The thyroid gland uses iodine from the foods you eat to make two main hormones: Triiodothyronine (T3) and Thyroxine (T4). Research suggests that hypothyroidism involves high levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and low levels of the thyroid hormones T4 and T3. Hypothyroidism is one of the main causes of weight gain and difficulty losing extra weight. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Adrenal Fatigue</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The adrenal glands (also known as suprarenal glands) are endocrine glands that sit on top of your kidneys. The adrenal cortex is involved in the production of hormones such as aldosterone, cortisol, and androgens. Adrenal fatigue can be a physiological response due to the “fight or flight” situation that we encounter daily. However, if you are living in an industrialized country the threat is more psychological than real. Adrenal fatigue makes it almost impossible to lose weight and it can contribute to weight gain around the abdomen.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Insulin Resistance or Blood Sugar Imbalance</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Insulin resistance occurs when cells fail to respond normally to the hormone insulin. Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that allows your body to use sugar (glucose) from carbohydrates in the food that you eat for energy or store glucose. A poor diet, an unhealthy lifestyle, and poor emotional health can all contribute to blood sugar imbalance, therefore, insulin resistance. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The hormonal imbalance might be due to environmental toxins.

Hormone disruptors such as Paraben, Tributyltin and Bisphenol A can cause problems with metabolism.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">5. Emotions</span></h4>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2070\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2070\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2070\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/yuris-alhumaydy-mSXMHkgRs8s-unsplash-1-1024x685.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"685\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/yuris-alhumaydy-mSXMHkgRs8s-unsplash-1-1024x685.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/yuris-alhumaydy-mSXMHkgRs8s-unsplash-1-300x201.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/yuris-alhumaydy-mSXMHkgRs8s-unsplash-1-768x514.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2070\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Yuris Alhumaydy on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Whether you suffer from depression, anxiety, or any situation that is affecting your mind, your body is looking for comfort. So, the message this time is let’s pack on fat to keep warm or let’s eat more to compensate for the sad times. Your body is intelligent, the mind is even more powerful. As you are emotionally starving, the chemicals in your body send the signal to store the unhealthy fat just to compensate for the grief, the lack of true identity and/or lack of confidence. The excess weight is just an expression of your subconscious and your spiritual “self”. </span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">6. Lack of Exercise</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Exercise is just an expression, a word. You can keep fit and healthy even if you skip the gym, however, you still have work to do. Whether it’s dancing, walking, swimming, or just gardening, your body needs to move. Fat is less dense and very detrimental to your health, especially in the wrong places. Exercise is also a way to beat emotional issues and keep the joints moving.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">7. Brain Workout</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Depending on age, gender, height and weight, and overall health, if we assume an average resting metabolic rate of 1,500 calories, then the brain consumes 260 of those calories just to keep things in order. This insignificant amount will not help you lose a lot of weight, however, doing something you enjoy can help lowering stress and increase productivity. Without burning yourself out; start feeding and working out your brain. Be creative, learn something new.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">8. Poor Sleep</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Poor sleep is one of the major causes of unhealthy fat build around the abdomen. Good sleep keeps the hormones cortisol in check and therefore enhances regular fat burning. Cortisol has many functions; it helps the body use sugar (glucose) and fat for energy (metabolism), and it helps the body manage stress. However, with poor sleep comes a build-up of this hormone which can increase fat around the abdomen. </span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">9. Not Enough Protein</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Protein is the building block of the body/muscles. Proteins are considered long-chain amino acids. Protein is used to develop, grow, and maintain just about every part of our body — from our skin and hair to our digestive enzymes and immune system antibodies. The two main symptoms of low protein are sluggish metabolism and trouble losing weight!</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">10. Dehydration</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Almost two-thirds of the human body is made up of water. Water acts as a natural appetite suppressant. Dehydration causes a drop in testosterone levels, which causes an increase in belly fat. Also, dehydration can cause your metabolism to slow down, affecting how your body burns fat. </span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ways to Keep Healthy to Lose Weight</span></h4>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2071\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2071\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2071\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/sara-dubler-VMBh604X0M0-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/sara-dubler-VMBh604X0M0-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/sara-dubler-VMBh604X0M0-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/sara-dubler-VMBh604X0M0-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/sara-dubler-VMBh604X0M0-unsplash-391x260.jpg 391w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2071\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Sara Dubler on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is best to find out about any underlying condition through the help of a gastroenterologist or endocrinologist.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Eat <a href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/how-to-create-an-anti-inflammatory-diet-shopping-list-5-important-facts/\">anti-inflammatory</a> spices and foods, and foods rich in probiotics.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If possible, go for a colon and liver cleanse.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Take some healthy supplements such as green tea extract with CLA or forskolin for weight loss.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Normalize blood sugar with B-complex vitamins, magnesium, and herbal remedies such as bitter melon, Buchu, or Gymnema Sylvestre.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Take a multivitamin, and vitamin D, zinc and fish oil.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Make sure to have adequate alkaline water.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Do something that matters, something that inspires you as well as others.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Finally, exercise your body to keep fit.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Be positive</h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Whether you are slim or overweight, the goal is to love yourself and get a positive image. Don&#8217;t try to lose weight to look good but rather to feel good. Do it properly with good foods, good nutrients, exercise, weight lifting, and fresh air; get enough oxygen. Everyone is unique, so your goal and nutrition should also be unique to you. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">So, before embarking on a new crash diet and ingesting low-quality pills, just do some research. It is a vicious circle, any hormonal imbalances, any deficiency as well as low exercise or environmental toxins can lead to unhealthy weight gain.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A word of Caution</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Talk to your doctor or healthcare provider before using any supplement or herb.
