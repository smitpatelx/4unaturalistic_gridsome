Then, just as significantly perimenopause, menopause, and post-menopause. We go from teens to having children and before you know it, menopause hits. </span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"justify\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Female hormones govern very specific times of change and they determine so much of how we experience life on a daily basis. Simultaneously, there is another gland in the body that plays a pivotal role in their energy and stress levels, and that is the adrenal gland.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"justify\"><span lang=\"en-US\">As the hormone levels drop in the ovaries, the adrenal glands help to take over female hormonal production. While at the same time, they continue to produce hormones, such as testosterone, cortisol, and adrenaline. The hormones that give us the drive to wake in the morning; and deal with ongoing stressors of the day. </span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"justify\"><!--more--></p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"justify\"><span lang=\"en-US\">The adrenal glands and menopause</span></h4>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">The adrenals glands are small glands that are situated near the top of the kidneys. They secrete the hormones cortisol and epinephrine; which are commonly referred to as stress hormones. The cell receptors for both cortisol and epinephrine fluctuate in the body. Depending on how much stimulation they receive by the nervous system.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\"> This is based on several factors, such as long term stress and the use of substances; such as caffeine, alcohol, and sugar. Lack of exercise also play a major role as well as emotions. This can lead to an overactive or underative adrenal. Such problem can contribute to low immunity. The </span><span lang=\"en-US\">Side effects are as follow:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-US\">insomnia,</span></li>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-US\"> moodiness, </span></li>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-US\">chronic infections </span></li>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-US\">and even immune disorders. </span>As stress builds in the mind and body, so the adrenal glands will suffer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"justify\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Healthy adrenal function in the body promotes restful sleep and a sense of wellbeing in the person. They also can have an effect on the thyroid system, which is a key component in regulating things such as hormones and brain activity; blood circulation, calcium balance, tissue maintenance, and even the temperature of the body. A lower thyroid function is somewhat common during perimenopause. It can also cause symptoms of menopause to become much worse if left unchecked.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"justify\"><span lang=\"en-US\">When the adrenal glands and thyroid are both unbalanced, it can result in a condition called &#8220;hypothyroidism&#8221;; which symptoms include: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-US\">fatigue, </span></li>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><a href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/10-major-reasons-why-you-are-not-losing-weight-and-keeping-it-off-hormone-and-gut-connection-explained/\"><span lang=\"en-US\">weight gain, </span></a></li>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-US\">depression and mood swings,</span></li>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-US\">cold hands and feet, </span></li>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-US\">constipation, </span></li>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-US\">severe and frequent hot flashes and/ or night sweats, </span></li>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><a href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/how-to-cope-with-low-libido-7-natural-aphrodisiacs-for-her/\">reduced libido</a>, and sleep disorders. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"justify\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Is it any wonder that a woman would want to keep these two glands in good condition? Once the hormones are out of balance, the body can react in very unpredictable ways. </span></p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"justify\"><span lang=\"en-US\">How the adrenal glands can trigger early menopause symptoms?</span></h4>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"justify\"><span lang=\"en-US\">They produce high levels of female hormones as they take over the role from the ovaries. They become the main site of estrogen and progesterone production in the body. This, however, places more demand on the adrenal glands. It can lead to symptoms of adrenal fatigue as well as reduced energy levels; and feeling overwhelmed by daily activities and an inability to cope with daily stressors. Women who are already experiencing adrenal fatigue may go through menopause earlier. They may experience more symptoms than women whose adrenal function is optimal.</span></p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"justify\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Foods for adrenal support</span></h4>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1314 size-large\" src=\"https://lanaturolistica.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/oscar-nord-627731-unsplash-866x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"766\" /></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2056\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2056\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-2056 size-large\" title=\"Omega's \" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hoan-vo-gxWsRTgC_Vg-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hoan-vo-gxWsRTgC_Vg-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hoan-vo-gxWsRTgC_Vg-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hoan-vo-gxWsRTgC_Vg-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hoan-vo-gxWsRTgC_Vg-unsplash-391x260.jpg 391w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2056\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Hoan Vo on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"justify\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Nutrition is always the key to making sure that the adrenal glands are taken care of.

As they are only caught from the deep section of the ocean. But it is worth it because they are high in Omega 3. Which is a very important for the adrenal glands.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4 lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"justify\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Whole Grains – </span></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"justify\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Fiber is a must for a healthy adrenal gland diet. The carbohydrates found in these grains help add natural energy in the adrenal glands; as well as fight back against unnecessary fatigue.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4 lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"justify\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Kelp – </span></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"justify\"><span lang=\"en-US\">It is known for its pituitary and adrenal gland cleansing properties. It also contains natural iodine which helps prevent disorders targeting the thyroid.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4 lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"justify\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Turkey – </span></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"justify\"><span lang=\"en-US\">It might be surprising for some but turkey is considered a lean protein-rich food.

People who have adrenal fatigue are often depleting their B5 levels. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"justify\"><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">P-5-P <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6257116/\">(1</a>): Vitamin B6</span></strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"justify\"><span lang=\"en-US\">B6 Vitamin is an important nutrient for the production of the neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine. Which play an important role in mood, sleep, energy, and mental impulse. In addition, B6 is a key part of the body&#8217;s ability to manufacture the stress hormones norepinephrine and epinephrine.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"justify\"><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">Vitamin C (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC201008/\">2</a>):</span></strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"justify\"><span lang=\"en-US\">This antioxidant is directly related to the production of cortisol in the adrenal cortex. In addition, it strengthens the immune system. It also protects the adrenal tissue from excessive oxidative stress related to the heavy production of adrenal hormones.</span></p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-GB\">Herbs to help balancing the adrenals</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\">Borage is also known as star-flower. It is a plant that is used occasionally as a herb. It contains calcium, potassium, and mucilages. It can also help to rejuvenate the adrenal glands; as well as improving blood circulation and certain skin conditions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\">Ashwagandha (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4658772/\">3</a>) is an adaptogen said to be equal to ginseng. It reduces inflammation and helps counteract the effect of certain detrimental fungi. It contains various antioxidants and helps with energy, stamina, and sexual performance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Siberian Ginseng (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5856322/\">4</a>) can help support the adrenals. It prevents the release of Corticosteroid Hormones from the adrenal glands in response to stress. it can also prevent to atrophy of the adrenal glands.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span lang=\"en-CA\">A word of Caution</span></h4>\n<p><span lang=\"en-CA\">Talk to your doctor or healthcare provider before using any supplement or herb.
