However, it appears to be more common in women than in men. Studies have shown that at least 32 percent of women and at least 15 percent of men have a very low sex drive. A decreased libido is no respecter of age. It may show up whether you’re at the low end of the age spectrum or at the high end.</p>\n<p>It may strike for many reasons such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>stress,</li>\n<li>depression,</li>\n<li>prescription medications,</li>\n<li>and relationship issues,</li>\n<li>misuse of drugs or alcohol,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/why-women-in-their-30s-and-early-40s-cant-lose-belly-fat-how-to-fight-belly-fat/\">obesity,</a></li>\n<li>and <a href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/how-to-say-good-bye-to-pms-with-lifestyle-change/\">hormonal imbalance;</a></li>\n<li>and low testosterone.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is natural for people to wonder how they could raise their libido. If you’ve got no sex drive or very little of it, there’s no need to panic. You’re not the only one out there. The good news is that there are lots of natural remedies to help boost your libido.</p>\n<p>By following these, you will experience an increase in your libido in no time. If your goal is to have a higher sex drive, then you’ve got to make some changes to your lifestyle. For example, you may have to work on your stress levels (decreasing it), spend more time sleeping, lace your meals with natural aphrodisiacs, and exercising adequately to put your mind and body back into a libido – encouraging state.</p>\n<p>These are all ways of increasing your libido naturally without resorting to the use of toxic drugs.<br />\n<!--more--></p>\n<h4><strong style=\"font-size: inherit;\">Major causes of low libido or total loss of sexual desire in women include:</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Relationship issues</li>\n<li>Medical conditions (such as thyroid disorders, endometriosis, and fibroids).</li>\n<li>Sociocultural factors (media images of sexuality and job stress etc.).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>The other factors.</h4>\n<p>When discussing the issue of libido increase, two important factors must be taken into consideration. These factors are both biological chemicals called prolactin and dopamine. A theory has it that dopamine raises sexual desire while prolactin decreases it. If you take medications, you should understand that some of these medications might stimulate the secretion of prolactin or inhibit the release of dopamine. Whatever the case, both lead to a decrease in sexual drive or cause other side effects.</p>\n<h4>The impact of low libido in women</h4>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2422\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2422\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2422\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/imani-clovis-L1kLSwdclYQ-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/imani-clovis-L1kLSwdclYQ-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/imani-clovis-L1kLSwdclYQ-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/imani-clovis-L1kLSwdclYQ-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2422\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Imani Clovis on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p lang=\"zxx\">Thе dесrеаѕе in libido іn women саn сrеаtе stress аnd may lead to depression іn bоth the wоmеn аnd hеr раrtnеr.

We are therefore advised to consume foods loaded with vitamin C daily. Also, vitamin C has been linked to healthier libido in females. Some excellent choices include oranges, red peppers, and guava.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Foods that are rich in iron</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Women with low iron levels in the blood may have their arousal affected.

In women, it leads to a looser vaginal wall. To increase the levels of collagen, it is mandatory that we ingest bone broths while opting for a collagen supplement powder.
