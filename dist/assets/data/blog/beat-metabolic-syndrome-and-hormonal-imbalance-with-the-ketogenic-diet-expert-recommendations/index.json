They are usually advised to try out the ketogenic diet. This is a diet that apart from being healthy and safe, it is a good recommendation if you happen to be diabetic or have a history of it.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">This specific diet contains more fat and fewer carbohydrates. The keto digests the fats in a process called ketosis to get the energy that is being used in the whole body.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Ketosis occurs by endogenous meaning that the body produces its own ketones a process achieved by eliminating carbohydrate intake. The glucose in the fats will also balance the sugar levels in the body that is why it is perfect for people with diabetes and metabolic syndrome issues, among others. It is a form of replacement for carbohydrates, which is known to cause harm to a lot of people.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">There are different types of groups of people who are often advised to try out this diet. It may not be necessarily a cure but a control measure to manage the effect it will have on the affected. I have been able to highlight a few of the issues and how this diet benefits them.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><!--more--></p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-US\">Metabolic syndrome</h4>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2030\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2030\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-2030 size-large\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kinga-cichewicz-FVRTLKgQ700-unsplash-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kinga-cichewicz-FVRTLKgQ700-unsplash-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kinga-cichewicz-FVRTLKgQ700-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kinga-cichewicz-FVRTLKgQ700-unsplash-768x513.jpg 768w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kinga-cichewicz-FVRTLKgQ700-unsplash-391x260.jpg 391w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2030\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Kinga Cichewicz on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">This is a health condition where the body is in a poor state. This means that one may be susceptible to diabetes or even heart disease among many other health issues. It happens more so when the insulin levels cannot be controlled during its production. It may be too low or too high.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Some of the characteristics of metabolic syndrome are increased blood pressure, high blood sugar levels, too much fat around the waist, high levels of triglyceride, and reduced levels of proper cholesterol levels.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">The ketogenic diet having the ability to break down the fat particles into manageable ones reduces the risk of metabolic syndrome. The body, therefore, becomes able to handle amounts of fat that are healthy and important for an average human body to function.</p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-US\">Type 2 diabetes</h4>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">This type of diabetes is where the body resists insulin or does not want to use it. It is the most common form of diabetes in society today. That is why it should be handled more intently than the other types of diabetes.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">The ketogenic diet being more of fats than carbohydrates ensure the body gets enough of the glucose from the fats. Insulin is usually used to break down the carbohydrates into glucose. Lowering the amounts of carbohydrates that need to be processed reduces the need for insulin in the body.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Therefore, although insulin is being resisted the body is still able to function correctly. Such facts about the ketogenic diet have risen a debate among many clinicians about whether this diet can reverse the type 2 diabetes. Though many believe it is just a way of handling it and not curing it.</p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-US\">Thyroid issues</h4>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">The thyroid is a special gland in the neck region of every human being. The thyroid produces a hormone that works more like an energizer. Production of too many hormones results in a condition called hyperthyroidism, and the production of less hormone can cause hypothyroidism.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">A ketogenic diet helps to balance the amounts in which the thyroid produces the hormone. It also helps to ensure that the body is not overly excited or is exposed to too much expectation. Hyperthyroidism may cause heart failure, and hypothyroidism may cause severe fatigue and sluggishness.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">It is, therefore important that the amounts are balanced. The diet helps the person involved in it to have a more balanced reaction to hormones.</p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-US\">Hormonal imbalance</h4>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-519 size-large\" src=\"https://lanaturolistica.blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/asdrubal-luna-485688-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"432\" /></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">This is a state where the body is unable to process the hormones properly. That is why people are easily fatigued, with high levels of anxiety, insomnia, and also <a href=\"https://lanaturolistica.blog/2019/03/10-major-reasons-why-you-are-not-losing-weight-and-keeping-it-off-hormone-and-gut-connection-explained/\">great weight gains</a>.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">The ketogenic diet is known for the healthy fats that it works with to break down getting the energy the body needs. The ketogenic diet allows the body to ensure that hormones produced like the ones on the thyroid are balanced and active.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">The nutrients in this diet ensure that you, as the user, can also get enough sleep as often as you need. The 8 hours of sleep that is advised will be useful in ensuring that the body is well functioning.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Especially to ladies, it changes or balances the amount of estrogen that is produced when they are menstruating. The ketogenic diet reduces the sugars and refined carbohydrates. It, therefore, may not altogether remove but it aims to balance out the effect that it could have had on her.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">The ketogenic diet may also be the flag off of symptoms of PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) which is caused by an imbalance of the sex hormone. It may also result in infertility for the males. Various studies were conducted that proved that despite no cure for such an illness, the ketogenic diet increases their chances of reproducing.</p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-US\">Other Health Benefits:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li lang=\"en-US\">In his article &#8220;Keto vs Paleo: Which Diet is Right for You&#8221;? Ryan Rodal says that &#8220;Keto might even help improve health conditions characterized by inflammation through the signaling actions of the ketone body <span lang=\"zxx\"><a href=\"https://hvmn.com/blog/exogenous-ketones/beta-hydroxybutyrate-or-bhb-all-you-need-to-know\">beta-hydroxybutyrate (or BHB)</a></span>, which blocks NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated inflammatory disease. Animal studies have shown the ketogenic diet may improve longevity, memory, and health span&#8221;.</li>\n<li lang=\"en-US\">The Ketogenic Diet is often used for the treatment of Epilepsy as epileptics tend to suffer from Alkalosis. The Ketogenic Diet encourages Acidosis, the opposite of Alkalosis)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 lang=\"en-US\">Dos and don&#8217;ts for beginners.</h4>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2031 size-full\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/canstockphoto30936065-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"749\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/canstockphoto30936065-2.jpg 749w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/canstockphoto30936065-2-281x300.jpg 281w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px\" /></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">I once tried the ketogenic diet and trust me, the journey was not good at first. It is possible that your body may retaliate and reject the new menu the way mine did. This means you will have to endure long hours of constipation. This also means that your energy levels will go low that you will be unable to make it to your daily appointments.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">This should not discourage you, though. I later came to know some things that if I had known earlier. The process wouldn&#8217;t have to be that brutal.</p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-US\">Dos.</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Have a lengthy discussion with your doctor regarding your health issues.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Have a reason for doing the ketogenic diet.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Understand your body&#8217;s metabolism. It will allow you to know what foods to major on.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Drink a lot of water often.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 lang=\"en-US\">Don&#8217;ts.</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Do not start the diet all at once. Your body may react and cause you some severe constipation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Don&#8217;t combine the ketogenic diet without a reliable doctor&#8217;s supervision.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Do not plan on taking the ketogenic diet for long. It may eventually lead to increased levels of acidity, which is not suitable for your body.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 lang=\"en-US\">Who should not use Keto?</h4>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">There are various groups of people that have been singled out from the ketogenic diet. It is not that it is biased, but precisely because it may cause more harm than good to them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4 lang=\"en-US\">On medication</h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">If you are a person who is already on an insulin prescription, embarking on a ketogenic diet may result in your sugar levels dropping lower than 70 ml per deciliter, which leads to Hypoglycemia. Other types of drugs may also be reactive to the change in diet. This is why it is advised to talk to your physician before you start this diet.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4 lang=\"en-US\">Children. It is more like a restriction than a denial</h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Children are known to be very active when they are young. They also need the energy to ensure they grow physically. Limiting the number of carbohydrates may lower their growth rate, which will eventually affect their maturity.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4 lang=\"en-US\">Old age people</h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">The older one grows, the feebler and weak they get. Therefore, committing to a ketogenic diet may not be appropriate for such people. However, this will only work of the specific person has a healthy functioning metabolic system. The energy levels are essential to ensure they still move around and do not have to depend on the people entirely.</p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-US\">Best way to stick with the diet for busy people.</h4>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">When you are dealing with a busy schedule, it could get hard to even handle a simple diet, let alone a ketogenic diet. However, over the years, we have come up with more straightforward ways that people have used to stay within the limits of the ketogenic diet.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">To busy people, it may sound extreme, but they are simple practices that will boost your diet plan.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Concentrate more on eating a high vitamin, and healthy fat compared to the readily available cabs foods.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Instead of your usual morning coffee or tea, try green tea when you wake up for a while and rate if it is useful to you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Have a constant note of your cabs in the body. This is mainly through the hidden sugars that creep in the diet like processed sugar in snacks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Often check if the ketosis process is going on or not. This will help in knowing if the process is functioning or not.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">As much as you would want a results-right-away type of regime, it is going to be hard for you. You should learn to practice a bit of patience so that you allow your body to adjust.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Drink a lot of water. This helps in digestion and also diluting the ketones that are created in the body.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Ensure you sleep the required number of hours of sleep every day. This will ensure that your body has enough rest and the ketosis process is continuing safely.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 lang=\"en-US\">Best natural foods and supplements to support the <a href=\"https://lanaturolistica.blog/2018/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-k%d0%b5t%d0%beg%d0%b5n%d1%96%d1%81-d%d1%96%d0%b5t/\">keto diet.</a></h4>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Well, supplements also assist the ketogenic diet and can help to go into ketosis faster, such as the:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><span lang=\"zxx\"><a href=\"https://hvmn.com/ketone\">HVMN Ketone</a></span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><span lang=\"zxx\"><a href=\"https://hvmn.com/blog/exogenous-ketones/what-are-exogenous-ketones\">Exogenous ketone</a></span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Magnesium</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Selenium</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Vitamin D</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Omega&#8217;s</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">MCT oil</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Electrolytes</p>\n</li>\n<li>Co Q 10</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Adaptogenic herbs</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Astragalus</li>\n<li>Maca</li>\n<li>Siberian Ginseng</li>\n<li>Ashwagandha</li>\n</ul>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">However, some foods have been pointed out to be useful to the health of a person even during the ketogenic diet practice. These nutrient supplements will enhance the breaking down of fats in the body and ensure that the levels are balanced.</p>\n<h4>     1. Magnesium.</h4>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">This mainly contained in carbohydrates, and with the limited amount, the body may end up lacking. Such nutrients then help to cover up for the ones requiring.

Calcium.</h4>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">This is mainly contained in milk products. In the ketogenic diet, milk has a high concentration of carbohydrates.
