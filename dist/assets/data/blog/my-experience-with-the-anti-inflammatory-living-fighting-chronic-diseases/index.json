For a long time, I suffered in silence with an array of symptoms.

It means to live a better lifestyle with healthy foods and habits. I started an organic, non-GMO, non-refined/ unprocessed lifestyle. I investigated farm-oriented meat, eggs, wild caught fish and a dirty dozen list, and finally came up with a plan.<!--more--></p>\n<h4>The journey</h4>\n<p>I limited my caffeine intake, ate natural and did my best to spend time in nature; doing activities that I liked, and learned to practice mindfulness. However, I will tell you that I still had a couple of issues. I was still tired, overwhelmed and still had my panic attacks; and don&#8217;t forget the hormonal imbalance that plagued me for years. I realized that because it says &#8220;natural&#8221; does not mean that it is safe. I learned to translate jargon; it means I learned to detect the hidden enemies. It can be called natural but still contain fake stuff. I began to investigate and learned to avoid easy words.</p>\n<p>Later on, though, I was still unhappy. So, what went wrong? Well, as I mentioned before, not everything can be good for everyone. The thing that helped the most was finding the foods that I am sensitive to. Something might be healthy and great for many people but what if it was making my system work harder; because I was sensitive to it. I embarked on an epic journey of identifying my hidden food <a href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/the-terrible-truth-about-food-sensitivity-ways-to-find-out-and-protect-your-gut/\">sensitivities and intolerances.</a> Guess what? That made a huge difference. It was not easy because it was hard to do while I was working, studying, and had to perform other duties.</p>\n<h4><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-910 size-large\" src=\"https://lanaturolistica.blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/milo-mcdowell-2198-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"432\" />The plan: Eliminating the threats</h4>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1950 size-full\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/food-se..jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"717\" height=\"231\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/food-se..jpg 717w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/food-se.-300x97.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px\" /></p>\n<p>I started slow; my first elimination list was as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>dairy,</li>\n<li>wheat,</li>\n<li>gluten,</li>\n<li>oats,</li>\n<li>eggs,</li>\n<li>soy,</li>\n<li>corn,</li>\n<li>sugar,</li>\n<li>caffeine,</li>\n<li>nuts and peanuts,</li>\n<li>nightshades, and finally even some red meat like pork and beef (which was not an actual sensitivity).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Careful, it might be leaky gut.

It did make a lot of difference. Now I will implore you to consider helping yourself by being patient. Next, it doesn’t mean that if you have friends or family following a specific diet or restriction because of a certain ailment or personal reason; that you should do the same.</p>\n<h4>Find out what works for you.</h4>\n<p>If you feel overwhelmed and sick from certain foods, just avoid them. If not, what is the need? I will not influence you in any case. I am using my personal story to show you that you are not alone. For my own ailments, many of these mentioned above did not work for me. For example, it is no longer a secret that dairy is “mucusy” and in high consumption can contribute to many inflammatory diseases. Unfortunately, I had to learn the hard way. In fact, all my family cannot consume dairy products, followed by nightshades and caffeine.</p>\n<h4>Indigestion versus actual sensitivities.</h4>\n<p>Last, indigestion that I was having with pork and beef was not actual sensitivities or allergies. It was more like a lack of enzymes to break down the protein that these meats contain. Not to be rude toward people who consume them, but I think that they can be hard to digest; hard on the<a href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/10-major-reasons-why-you-are-not-losing-weight-and-keeping-it-off-hormone-and-gut-connection-explained/\"> gut</a>, and even contribute to certain ecological issues.</p>\n<p>As I took dairy, gluten, and the other sensitivities and certain meat out of my life, I was ok but still not fine. So, I continued until realizing that it was a poor combination of food that I was experiencing. Mixing protein with starch, or fruits with other things, I had to learn to create balance.</p>\n<h4>The wrong combination of foods</h4>\n<p>Fruits are eaten alone and in the morning or as an early snack. I started mixing my fruits based on their acidic, neutral, or alkaline properties. I started eating protein with salad and avoided mixing too many types of proteins. Finally, I started having starch only with other starch, or with salad.</p>\n<h4>Know yourself</h4>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1949 size-full\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/canstockphoto57688158-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/canstockphoto57688158-1.jpg 800w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/canstockphoto57688158-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/canstockphoto57688158-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/canstockphoto57688158-1-391x260.jpg 391w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>The following were the symptoms that I would get each time I consumed the wrong kinds of foods; or the wrong combinations of foods: gas, flatulence, bloating, headache, ocular migraine, anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, mood swings, and even joint pain – all of which equals an absolute mess.</p>\n<p>I never paid attention before. I come from a place where our diets were varied, and we did not have to deal with reading labels to avoid added ingredients, and we made our treats an occasional moment. However, the change in our culture has made these foods imperative to eat if we want something fast and delicious. So, having to consume them repetitively was becoming too much; my body couldn’t cope, and I was tired and overwhelmed. Not only did I eat them in large amounts all the time, but some of these foods were not in their natural state by the time they reached my mouth and my gut. That is why I urge people to make their food at home every time they can, and eat what is clean and works for them.</p>\n<p>Now, you must be thinking: How can someone have this much time to do this? But I was desperate, sick, and tired. I made time, I stopped my excuses and created a plan. Everything in life needs a plan, whether you map an idea in your head or you write a full protocol, it is a plan. I had to take care of myself so I could take care of others. I had to be strong so I could bring awareness. I never said it was easy, it&#8217;s a choice.</p>\n<h4>My most common excuses were:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>I don’t have time</li>\n<li>I am working full time</li>\n<li>I have a house or family to take care of</li>\n<li>Life is short, and I don’t want to worry about what I eat</li>\n<li>I don’t’ know how to make fast food</li>\n<li>I need a lot of money to eat healthily and so on</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you really want a job, wouldn’t you work hard to get it? Don’t you spare time to be at social events? How will you be of any help if you don’t take care of yourself? Do you care about others? How much time do you spend on social media?</p>\n<p>I am not attacking, judging, or criticizing anyone. It’s just to demystify the common things that can keep you from eating healthy.</p>\n<h4><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-911 size-large\" src=\"https://lanaturolistica.blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_0103-1-1024x690.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"437\" />Final thought</h4>\n<p>Finally, give a blessing for your food. Whether you are religious or not, the best thing you can be is grateful. Not enough people are grateful nowadays, increasing the chance of diseases and unwanted energy. Learn to give thanks for having the chance to eat, and to be around and spend time with others.</p>\n<p>Cheers and best of luck!</p>\n<h4>You can also watch my video about healthy substitute for Gut health and hormonal imbalance.</h4>\n<p class=\"responsive-video-wrap clr\"><iframe title=\"5 Foods &amp; Drinks to Avoid + Healthy Substitute for Gut &amp; Hormonal Balance\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vC5Tmpa1UAo?start=35&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I became healthy and free I want you to feel the same too.
