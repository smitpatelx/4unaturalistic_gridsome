But how many of us have ever heard of them? And where do they come from?</span></p>\n</div>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientists predict that the advent of these tiny organisms are capable of converting sunlight, heat, water, and minerals into:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">proteins,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">carbohydrates,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">vitamins,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and amino acids marks the beginning of life around 3 1/2 billion years ago.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">These small organisms are called phytoplankton. The unicellular plants that form the basis of all other life forms on planet Earth. They are the &#8220;vegetation&#8221; of the</span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/seawater-health-benefits-the-rejuvenating-effect/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> ocean</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">. Not only does it provide important food for humans, but phytoplankton is also responsible for producing up to 90% of Earth&#8217;s oxygen.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">They provide us directly with vital life &#8211; as a source of valuable vitamins and minerals &#8211; and indirectly as a source of our oxygen.</span></p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What are Phytoplanktons?</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Phytoplankton is the food used by the world&#8217;s largest and longest-living animals and fish. Blue whales, bowhead whales, and many other whale species eat plankton. These species live between 80 and 150 years old and retain great strength and endurance throughout their lives. The largest fish is a plankton-eating whale shark that reaches over 150 years old, and grows up to 14 meters long, weighs up to 15 tons, and is sexually active until death.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This is what phytoplankton can do for marine life, and it can do a great deal for us as well, though it is not foreseeable that each of us will live for a century and a half.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Electrolytes</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The elements and electrolytes in the plankton are almost made to measure for the human body. It is not by chance that the composition of human plasma is similar to that of seawater. We emerged from the sea and our inner bodies reflect this. Our bodies need the micronutrients and trace elements found in phytoplankton to function as nature intended.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Trace minerals</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">On its own, the human body has a wonderful homeostasis system that keeps all systems in balance. Remove some critical components, such as a trace element, and the body malfunctions that result in suboptimal performance. Too many malfunctions can cause disease.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Phytoplankton provides many, if not all, of the trace minerals we need to maintain that balance in our bodies, helping us lead a full life in optimal health. These phytonutrients potentially show promising effects in human physiology.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Health benefits of phytoplankton in the human body</span></h4>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2294\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2294\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2294\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/canstockphoto69141080.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/canstockphoto69141080.jpg 800w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/canstockphoto69141080-300x200.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/canstockphoto69141080-768x513.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2294\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">chokniti</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Phytoplankton contains highly concentrated lipids (fats) to improve brain function, cardiovascular function and provide a healthy cell wall.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It has been clinically shown to lower cholesterol and stabilize blood sugar levels. Phytoplankton helps to increase mental alertness. It helps reduce body pain and inflammation, both inside the body and outside. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">We know how fast phytoplankton nourishes the whole body because external problems such as dandruff, eczema, psoriasis, and dermatitis get better so quickly. Because all external skin diseases derive from internal toxicity, we know how much phytoplankton nourishes and cleanses at the cellular level.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Other health benefits:</span></h4>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It protects the eyes.</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A very exciting feature of plankton is its ability to help the eyes, and it is shown to be more effective than lutein. Another component of the product is astaxanthin, which is also very beneficial for the eyes. Various studies show the amazing benefits of phytoplankton in supporting people with a macular degeneration due to astaxanthin.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It helps support the liver.</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">To restore our health, it is very necessary to detoxify and then rebuild.

Of course, when our liver is detoxified and strengthened, we sleep well and have more energy during our daily activities!</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Phytoplankton is a whole food.</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Doctors usually focus on recommending nutritional supplements to help the body get the nutrients it needs to help the body heal itself. But studies now show that instead of supplements, we can source our diet from complete whole foods, and that&#8217;s exactly what this product is. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If it can give all the food a large ocean-life mammal needs for its entire life, it can give us humans because we&#8217;re mammals too!</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Overview of how phytoplanktons might benefit humans:</span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">For the general diet, they contain ultra-potent lipids to improve brain function.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">They support a healthy heart with a variety of minerals and vitamins.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">They have been proven to stabilize blood sugar levels.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Phytoplankton in our diet supports us in general mental alertness and can fight ADHD, Parkinson&#8217;s and general dementia.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">They relieve pain and inflammation in our joints.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Prevent psoriasis and dermatitis.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This super-nutrient boosts your immune system enormously.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Your nervous system is strengthened along with your endocrine system.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It helps to speed up your recovery from illness and diseases.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Your skin will look more vibrant and younger.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is also effective in providing a natural allergy remedy.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It improves blood circulation and heart function.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It helps your body cells to protect themselves against radiation that exists in the environment.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Clinical tests show that phytoplankton can lower cholesterol.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">For a good view, studies show that phytoplankton may be more effective than lutein. Besides, they support a healthy liver, good sleep habits, and increased energy levels.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The list of nutrients available in phytoplanktons include:</span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">vitamins B12, C and E,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">magnesium,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">chlorophyll,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">potassium,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and many other vitamins and trace minerals.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How to use phytoplanktons safely?</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You can purchase Phytoplankton as a supplement in liquid form, but you can also get it in capsule or powder form. You can get it at your local health food store or online. Make sure to always read the labels before buying.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Keep in mind that the supplement can be in capsule, liquid or powder form.

So, always make sure to look for the word &#8220;GALA&#8217;. The name comes Galapagos Tortoise. This strain is the highest in Superoxide Dismutase that is responsible for longevity. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) is 1000 times more potent than Vitamin C. SOD is an enzyme produced as a by-product of oxygen. It is an anti-inflammatory agent that protects the body against oxidative stress; in other words, it can help fight degenerative issues such as cancer.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you already use concentrated green supplements as a part of your diet, then you probably will not mind putting it right under your tongue.</span></p>\n<h4>How to use it in your daily routine?</h4>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2279\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rawpixel-707572-unsplash-min-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"Image-Stock-2\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rawpixel-707572-unsplash-min-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rawpixel-707572-unsplash-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rawpixel-707572-unsplash-min-768x513.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If it&#8217;s too strong for you, you can add it to water, or coconut water or a small amount of juice.
