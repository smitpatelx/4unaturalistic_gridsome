A diverticulum is a small pouch that bulges outside of the colon walls. The term for multiple diverticulum is &#8220;diverticula&#8221;. Being in the state of the diverticulum is called diverticulosis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A person can have diverticulosis without knowing it. He or she can begin to feel the symptoms when the diverticula become infected and inflamed. Most people who have it don&#8217;t know until it&#8217;s late.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, I am going to share with you some remedies and foods that might rid of bowel pockets; and keep your colon healthy in the process.  </p>\n\n\n\n<!--nextpage-->\n\n\n\n<h4>What Causes The Diverticula To Become Inflamed?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When small particles of difficult digestible food become trapped in the diverticula, they rub against the walls of the intestines and develop a very small lesion or ulcer. This small ulcer ignites and can often be unfavorable to bacteria. The bacteria heavily populate the area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the bacteria enter the picture, the diverticula become very inflamed, swollen and painful. When inflammation occurs, the next step is a rupture. When a diverticulum ruptures, the result can be peritonitis or infection of the anterior gut.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Peritonitis can cause:</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>severe abdominal pain,</li><li>and tenderness,</li><li>vomiting,</li><li>fever,</li><li>and diarrhea,</li><li>as well as some other serious symptoms.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The result of this diverticulitis is often a serious surgical procedure. This surgery also called &#8220;intestinal resection&#8221;, is the actual &#8220;excision&#8221; of the affected diverticulum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the surgery, you have to avoid further episodes at any cost. Since the next step is often the application of a colostomy or the removal of a large portion of the colon; and the production of a tummy through or hole in the intestine from the defecation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Diverticulitis Symptoms</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of people are unaware of their condition until they experience some symptoms of diverticulitis such as nausea, vomiting, pain in lower abdomen and constipation. Some people will also experience abdominal cramps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that don&#8217;t delay your time to visit a doctor because if the symptoms are left untreated or it doesn&#8217;t get proper treatment, it will lead to a more serious problem and your condition will get worse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nSo, if you experience one or more of those symptoms, you should go to a doctor as soon as possible for further check-up and treatment.\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>For Diverticulosis, the symptoms are usually mild. They can be anything from:</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Constipation (or sometimes diarrhea)</li><li>Bloating</li><li>Cramping</li><li>Pain in the abdomen</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of people with Diverticulosis also have associated conditions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>IBS</li><li>GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease)</li><li>Prone to hernia&#8217;s</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Diverticulitis symptoms differ a little from the Diverticulosis, and goes as follows:</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Pain in the abdomen (lower left side)</li><li>Fever</li><li>Diarrhea or constipation</li><li>Bloating</li><li>Nausea or vomiting</li><li>Blood in stool</li><li>Not wanting to eat</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If left untreated can and will become worse, and surgery might be necessary. Eating food with enough fiber is essential to living healthy. Not only eating enough fiber, but also drinking plenty of water, and exercising regularly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>How is Diverticulitis diagnosed and treated?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The Diagnosis is determined by a series of tests like blood tests, x-ray or a CT scan, Colonoscopy, etc&#8230; Whatever test the doctor sees fit to diagnose you properly. The treatment is different for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some cases might not be as progressed as other cases, and may only require rest and a proper diet. Other cases may need more intensive treatment such as needing to take antibiotics or even surgery may be required.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Natural herbal treatments for diverticulitis</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are the natural ways of treating bowel pockets (diverticulitis).</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Aloe Vera juice</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Aloe vera juice has a strong healing effect on indigestion such as diverticulitis. With regular use, most people report positive results within 3 to 30 days, depending on their condition. It is also a good base for mixing liquid tincture herbs, which can sometimes have a strong taste. If necessary, you can also add lemon juice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Papaya Leaf</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jakob-owens-_0NCVmpAGr8-unsplash-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2236\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jakob-owens-_0NCVmpAGr8-unsplash-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jakob-owens-_0NCVmpAGr8-unsplash-150x150.jpg 150w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jakob-owens-_0NCVmpAGr8-unsplash-300x300.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jakob-owens-_0NCVmpAGr8-unsplash-768x768.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption> Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@jakobowens1?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Jakob Owens</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/papaya?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a> </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Papaya leaf extract, contains papain, a protein-dissolving enzyme that breaks down wheat gluten and carbohydrates for extra digestive protection. It has been very beneficial for digestion, and is said to stimulate the bowels in times of constipation, a common side effect of diverticulitis and is also believed to be useful in treating inflammatory bowel disorders.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Chamomile herbs</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Chamomile extract is often used for the calming effect on the digestive system while the walls of the digestive tract are tightened. This makes chamomile a very good choice as part of the treatment of diverticular disorders and inflammatory bowel conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chamomile stops spasms in the smooth lining in the stomach and intestines and contains anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral and antiparasitic chemicals. As an anticonvulsant, it helps with stomach cramps and can help with nausea, and stress-related flatulence.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Cats Claw</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOvZKQjVYGY\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cat&#8217;s Claw</a>&nbsp;comes from the Peruvian rainforests and is widely recognized as a superior immune stimulant with antioxidant, antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. It has been used to treat infections and a wide range of intestinal disorders, including diverticulosis and diverticulitis. it also acts against Helicobacter pylori, the bacterium associated with gastritis and peptic&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/a-n%d0%b0tur%d0%b0l-a%d1%80%d1%80r%d0%be%d0%b0%d1%81h-that-may-treat-acid-r%d0%b5flux-and-ulcer/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ulcers.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It effectively detoxifies and cleanse the intestinal tract and replenish friendly bacteria. Most intestinal diseases are the result of disrupting the growth of the productive flora, and without proper balance, the immune system can be compromised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, Cat&#8217;s Claw not only improves the natural defense system, but also alleviates the discomfort of bowel disorders such as diverticulitis, leaky gut, colitis, and diarrhea.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Slippery elm bark</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/canstockphoto13117681-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2237\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/canstockphoto13117681-1.jpg 800w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/canstockphoto13117681-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/canstockphoto13117681-1-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /><figcaption>© PixelsAway</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Slippery elm bark helps to reduce inflammation in the intestinal tract. Soothes the inflamed intestinal mucous membranes; and neutralizes excess acids in the intestines. It is beneficial for conditions such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Crohn&#8217;s disease,</li><li>ulcerative colitis,</li><li>diverticulitis and diverticulosis,</li><li>and irritable bowel syndrome.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Other health benefits</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It was also used to relieve constipation and chronic diarrhea. One of the oldest uses was as a tonic for the digestive tract; The high content of mucilage soothes the inflamed mucous membranes of the stomach, neutralizes excess stomach acid, making it an excellent remedy for the digestive system.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Final thoughts:</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people are not aware of such a problem and keep having the wrong diet. It is important to change your lifestyle, whether or not your bowel pockets are infected. I recommend consuming fresh foods and lots of soluble and insoluble fiber. Soluble fiber has a lot of prebiotics to help support your journey to wellness. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Increase more probiotics foods into your diet such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>sauerkraut, </li><li>kimchi, </li><li>and kefir contain<a href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/how-to-know-if-you-have-leaky-gut-supplements-review/\"> probiotics</a> that help replenish the gut flora. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p> It is best to avoid consuming anything that contains hard seeds such as apple seeds. As for flax or chia seeds you can soak them overnight or grind them before eating them or adding them to foods.  Don&#8217;t forget to drink lots of alkaline water to keep your digestive system energized.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4> <strong>Caution:</strong> </h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Always talk to your doctor or healthcare provider before attempting helping yourself on your own. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4> <strong>Reference</strong>:</h4>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<ul><li> Cat&#8217;s Claw and Diverticulitis (Research) Steinberg, P.
