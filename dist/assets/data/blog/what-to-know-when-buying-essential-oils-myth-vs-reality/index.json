Public records and studies show that Egyptians used essential oils, balsams, and perfumed oils; as well as scented barks, resins, spices, and aromatic vinegar daily. They even had a god called Nefertum; the god of perfume who was also the god of healing. The oils had all kinds of use such as purification of the soul, celebration of the gods, and mummification passage to the &#8220;after-life&#8221;; as well as <span style=\"font-size: inherit;\">house cleaning, and even to protect their skin under the sun.</span></p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">The beginning of aromatherapy and the use of essential oils in modern time</h3>\n<p>Essential oils are used by many different cultures all over the world. It was the French chemist and perfumer Rene Maurice Gattefosse who coined the term aromatherapy; as we know it today in 1937. A non-believer of the natural health movement; however, he became interested in essential oils after badly burning his hand during an experiment. He then plunged them into the nearest bath of liquid which just happened to be a lavender essential oil.<br />\nLater, he was astonished to see that the burn healed very quickly and left practically no scarring. His fascination with essential oils inspired him to experiment with them during the First World War on soldiers in military hospitals. He used oils of lavender, thyme, lemon and clove for their antiseptic properties.</p>\n<h4><strong>How is essential oil made?</strong></h4>\n<p>Oils are extracted in different ways. Most extraction techniques are based on the fact that the majority of essential oils mix well with oils; as well as fats, alcohol, and certain solvents but not with water. Most pure essential oils are extracted from plants through steam distillation.<br />\nThe plants are freshly picked then suspended over boiling water. The steam pulls the oils out of the plants, as the steam rises it is captured in a container and pushed through a tube. The steam is then cooled down and condensed back to the water. Since water and essential oils do not mix, the two separate and the oil is collected. They are also called Volatile Oils because they are very easily vaporized.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-902 size-large\" src=\"https://lanaturolistica.blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/anis-m-750751-unsplash-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"648\"></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_1928\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1928\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1928 size-large\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dorne-marting-WJJ3xP5Z_vw-unsplash-1024x769.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dorne-marting-WJJ3xP5Z_vw-unsplash-1024x769.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dorne-marting-WJJ3xP5Z_vw-unsplash-300x225.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dorne-marting-WJJ3xP5Z_vw-unsplash-768x577.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1928\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Dorné Marting on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h4><strong>How to use them for maximum absorption?</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Via the skin</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The skin is our largest organ, making it easier for many nutrients or toxins to get absorbed faster. Our bodies absorb directly into the bloodstream close to 60% of the topical products applied to the skin; massaging&nbsp; with essential oils is very healing. The skin is permeable to fat-soluble substances; and relatively impermeable to water-soluble substances. Carrier oils such as Sweet Almond or Grape-seed Oil can be used; as they are less thick and penetrate the skin faster.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Inhalation</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Another way to get great benefits out of it is by inhalation. Inhalation results in the stimulation of the limbic system of the brain. The nerve impulse in the limbic system leads to other areas of the brain that are responsible for secreting hormones; helping with metabolism and body function. </span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Three ways a person can inhale essentials oils:</span></h4>\n<ol>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The easiest way it to invest in an aroma diffuser to diffuse the scent.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The old fashion way is to stand head over a bowl of steaming hot water with some drops of essential oils; inhaling the steam, while covering the head with a towel. A routine that is best before bed. </span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A bottle of the desired essential oil can also be hold close to the nostrils for therapeutic effect.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Some are ingested</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The last way to use essential oil, is by ingestion. This is not recommended for many oils which are less absorbed through your digestive system. But some can be great for baking/cooking, resulting in the “feel-good effect” in wintertime. I use nutmeg, vanilla, lemon, clove, ginger, and orange or even a little lavender sometimes added to some of my recipes.</span></p>\n<h4><strong>Health benefits of essential oils</strong></h4>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_1929\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1929\" style=\"width: 819px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1929 size-large\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nicholas-safran-A8vD51kYmrs-unsplash-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nicholas-safran-A8vD51kYmrs-unsplash-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nicholas-safran-A8vD51kYmrs-unsplash-240x300.jpg 240w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nicholas-safran-A8vD51kYmrs-unsplash-768x960.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1929\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Nicholas Safran on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-903 size-large\" src=\"https://lanaturolistica.blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brittany-neale-668051-unsplash-1024x681.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"431\"></p>\n<p>Essential oils are used by massage therapists, nurses, reflexologists and beauticians, and so on.
