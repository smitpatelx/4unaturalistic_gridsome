The excessive consumption of sugar unbalances the pH levels of the body, which makes it difficult for us to lose weight and maintain good health. The sugar and the acidity it creates provides an internal environment that is ripe for the overgrowth of yeasts, fungi, and dangerous bacteria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In turn, these pathogens feed on sugar, multiply and expel the toxic waste that makes us feel even worse. Because these bad bacteria feed on sugar, our body begins to crave more sugar in the form of sweets, bread, pasta, and so on. We end up feeding these microorganisms and promote their growth and place more toxic acid in our body.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As this vicious circle\ncontinues, we not only feed these toxin-producing microorganisms, but\nwe also ingest huge amounts of high-calorie foods, nutrient voids,\nand sugar-laden foods. Over time, excessive consumption of calories\nthrough sugar obviously affects our health and leads to an increase\nin weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<h3>Reasons to quit eating sugar</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some reasons to\nquit sugar now &#8211; even if you think you don&#8217;t want to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Quitting sugar can help you prevent or even reverse insulin resistance. </h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/canstockphoto20918151-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2471\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/canstockphoto20918151-1.jpg 800w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/canstockphoto20918151-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/canstockphoto20918151-1-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /><figcaption>Body Shape by Liudacorolewa</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mainstream thinking of\ninsulin resistance is that overweight is the cause. That&#8217;s true, it\ncan be &#8212; but it&#8217;s a limited view. What we eat can greatly influence\nwhether or not we develop insulin resistance &#8211; or type 2 diabetes,\nwhich frequently follows it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4> It can prevent premature hunger signals.  </h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When sugar promotes a high\nproduction of insulin, glucose can go down very fast and very\nquickly. The rate at which it descends is the main factor in\ntriggering premature hunger signals: making you hungry for food you\ndo not need simply because you ate sugary junk.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4> It can reduce calorie intake. </h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re not responding\naddictively to sugar &#8211; and eating more sugar and other foods because\nof that &#8211; it will be easier to watch your calories.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4> It can make healthy foods taste better to you.  </h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Eating sugar triggers\nendorphins (beta-endorphin). That changes food preferences so that\nhealthy foods seem less appealing. When you stop taking sugar, eating\ngood foods, such as vegetables, will probably be more appetizing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>It can improve the overall nutritional value of your diet. </h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are not destroying\nyour appetite with sugary junk, you will have more room for healthy\nfood. If you&#8217;re not steeped in a junky direction by endorphins,\nyou&#8217;ll eat more healthful foods. If you are not eating the usual\nsugary sweets, you can increase the fiber in your diet. If you are\neating healthy foods, your intake of vitamin B can increase and\nchange the chemistry of your brain completely. That&#8217;s a mood factor\neven more significant than glucose.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>It can improve your health. </h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Sugar can impact health\ndirectly by increasing inflammation in the body through several\nmechanisms. Reducing inflammation can improve your health and\ndecrease pain</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>It can improve your mood and your energy. </h4>\n\n\n\n<p>People who are sensitive to\ncarbohydrates secrete more insulin than normal when they eat sugar.\nThat can establish a &#8220;peak and valley&#8221; pattern in your\nglucose levels. When you&#8217;re at a peak, your energy and mood may feel\noptimal, but when you&#8217;re in a valley, things don&#8217;t feel good at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Who should do a sugar cleanse?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sugar Detox is one of the most effective methods, which is effective and healthy. In essence, sugar removal and minimization of its levels in one&#8217;s body helps in loss of unwanted amounts of fat and increases the energy levels. The healthy and effective nature of the procedure arises from the fact that it focuses on the reduction of sugar levels in various foodstuffs and the avoidance of food that contain a high amount of sugar.
