In the tropics, people use them very often as cooked vegetables. Many believe that the plant is native to Southeast Asia.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The two groups of plantains with a common origin are:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">the horn plantain,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and the French plantain.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">These two types of plantain grow in India, Africa, Egypt and also tropical America.

When they get to your colon, they become food for the microbes in your gut and promote the growth of good bacteria.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When intestinal bacteria ferment these fibers, they create short-chain fatty acids that nourish the cells that line the intestines and keep them healthy and strong.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Interestingly, studies in humans have found that people with inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis, tend to have lower levels of short-chain fatty acids in the gut.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Other advantages of Taro</span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Reduce Diabetes Risk </span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Dietary fiber in Taro can help regulate insulin and blood sugar levels in your body and prevent your blood sugar levels from rising.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Improving eyesight.</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It contains antioxidants such as Cryptoxanthin and Beta-carotene that help keep free radicals at bay.
