However, it&#8217;s a good idea to measure most foods and drinks until you get a feel for the portion size. It&#8217;s an oversized world out there and most people are surprised that their idea of a single serving is two or three.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Some supermarkets have are food scales that are pre-programmed with nutrition information. As well as scales that keep a running total of your daily food and nutrient supply for you. However, the only tools you really need are a simple and inexpensive gram scale; and dry and liquid measuring cups and the idea of reading food labels.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Among all these tools, reading food labels seems to be the most effective way to determine the right kind of food that can be bought at the supermarket. It makes you choose reasonable food. You can use the &#8220;Nutrition Information&#8221; section of a specific item in the grocery store to determine the amount of serving sizes specified in this product.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><!--more--></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">With food labels, you can clearly understand the amount and type of nutrients that are included in the item. It usually contains information on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>saturated fat,</li>\n<li>sodium,</li>\n<li>total fat,</li>\n<li>fiber and cholesterol &#8220;per serving&#8221;.</li>\n</ul>\n<p align=\"justify\">However, reading and understanding food labels can be very confusing for a typical consumer. A typical consumer would definitely ask what these numbers mean and how this affects the diet if they follow the serving service indicated on the food label.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">For a clearer and more complete understanding of the items on the food label, here is a list of things you need to know:</p>\n<h4 align=\"justify\">Reading is important</h4>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2197\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2197\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2197\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/boxed-water-is-better-7H1hDt694s8-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/boxed-water-is-better-7H1hDt694s8-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/boxed-water-is-better-7H1hDt694s8-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/boxed-water-is-better-7H1hDt694s8-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2197\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Boxed Water Is Better on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1137 size-large\" src=\"https://lanaturolistica.blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/fancycrave-520420-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"432\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4 align=\"justify\">Serving size</h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p align=\"justify\">This is the main item you see on a food label. The amount of portions indicated on the food label refers to the amount of food that people normally consume. However, this does not necessarily mean that it reflects your very own food intake.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In addition, the serving size determines the number of nutrients that enter the body. In other words, if you strictly adhere to the serving size, you will receive the same amount of nutrients according to the serving size indicated on the label.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">For example, if the serving size says that a serving size equals 54 grams, that means you have to measure 54 grams and eat them and that means you&#8217;ve eaten just one serving. So to speak, the amount of nutrients shown on the food label is the same amount that has entered your body, taking into account the fact that you have just eaten 54 grams.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">However, if you have eaten everything and the food label says that each pack equals 4 servings, you need to calculate the number of nutrients that have entered your body. That means if the food label has 250 calories per serving, multiply it by four to get the total amount of calories you&#8217;ve taken.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4 align=\"justify\">Nutrient</h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p align=\"justify\">This refers to the list of available nutrients in a given item. It also indicates the nutritional information of the product based on the recommended daily allowance. Normally, the nutrient levels refer to both the 2,500 calorie diets and the 2,000 recommended supplements.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">To understand the numerical value of each item, you should know that the &#8220;% daily value&#8221; indicated by the food label actually depends on how a particular food complies with the recommended daily allowance of 2,000 calories.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">If in the event that you purchased an item that has a diet discount other than the 2,000 calorie diet, you divide the agreed amount by only 2,000, you can determine the &#8220;%&#8221; of the nutrients.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4 align=\"justify\">Ingredients</h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p align=\"justify\">This refers to the list of ingredients used to make the product. The list usually consists of the main ingredients, which have a greater weight fraction down to the smallest amount. This simply means that the actual amount of food contains the largest amount of the main ingredient or the first item and the minimum amount of the last ingredient.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4 align=\"justify\">Label claim</h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p align=\"justify\">This refers to the type of nutritional requirements of a particular food. For example, if an item says it is sodium-free, it has less than 5 milligrams per serving, or a low-fat item actually contains 3 grams or less of fat.</p>\n<h4 align=\"justify\">Top Four Toxic Ingredient to Find in Food</h4>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1136 size-large\" src=\"https://lanaturolistica.blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/canstockphoto44235344-1024x819.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"518\" /></p>\n<h4 align=\"justify\">The following are some of the most common counterfeit ingredients to avoid in foods:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>Shortening</h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p align=\"justify\">Give away foods that contain fat or partially hydrogenated oil as an ingredient, since they are also bad trans fats. They not only clog your arteries and cause obesity, but they also increase the risk of metabolic syndrome. Choose healthier monounsaturated fats like olive oil, coconut oil, and grapeseed oil, as well as foods containing unsaturated omega-3 fatty acids.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>Artificial sweeteners</h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"western\">Be careful as you see the words: &#8220;sugar-free&#8221; or &#8220;diet,&#8221; because it might be full of artificial sweetener.</p>\n<p class=\"western\">These products include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"western\">soft drinks,</li>\n<li class=\"western\">baked goods,</li>\n<li class=\"western\">candies,</li>\n<li class=\"western\">chewing gum,</li>\n<li class=\"western\">ice cream,</li>\n<li class=\"western\">jellies and fruit juice,</li>\n<li class=\"western\">and yogurt.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Aspartame, saccharin, and sucralose may be even more difficult in our metabolic systems than regular, old sugars. These supposedly diet-friendly sweeteners can actually do more harm than good.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"western\">Studies have suggested that artificial sweeteners cause the brain to forget that sweetness means extra calories and that people are more likely to continue eating sweets without abandoning it. Nip it in the bud. Scan ingredient labels and forbid all artificial sweeteners from entering your mouth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"western\">In this article, I outlined how to quit eating sugar. <a href=\"http://www.lanaturolistica.community/2019/01/how-important-it-is-to-quit-eating.html\">How Important it is to Quit Eating Sugar: 4 Simple Steps to Success.</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4 align=\"justify\">MSG (flavor enhancer)</h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p align=\"justify\">Monosodium glutamate is a processed &#8220;flavor enhancer&#8221;. While glutamates are present in some natural foods such as meat and cheese, the processed foods used by the processed food industry are separated from their host proteins by hydrolysis.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The jury is not yet sure how harmful MSG can be, but high levels of free glutamate have been shown to seriously affect brain chemistry. Do not fall victim to chemical flavor enhancement. Just play it safe and spice up your food in a natural way.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4 align=\"justify\">Color</h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p align=\"justify\">The artificial colors blue 1 and 2, green 3, red 3 and yellow 6 have been associated with thyroid, adrenal, bladder, kidney and brain tumors. Always look for foods with the least artificial chemicals, especially when shopping for your kids. Look for colorless medicines and natural foods that do not contain artificial colors like these.</p>\n<h4 align=\"justify\">Final thought</h4>\n<p align=\"justify\"><a name=\"_GoBack\"></a> Indeed, reading food labels can be very lengthy and confusing. But once you get the hang of it, it&#8217;s easier for you to pay attention to your diet because you can already control the amount of food you eat.</p>\n<h4 align=\"justify\">The Sugar Cleanse Lifestyle</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p align=\"justify\">Wondering how to reduce your sugar intake, re-balance your body, reset your metabolism and get rid of gut issues like acid reflux?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p align=\"justify\">The best way to achieve this is through a &#8220;Sugar cleanse&#8221;.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dairy Free</li>\n<li>Gut Healing Recipes</li>\n<li>Anti-inflammatory Tips</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your journey to overcoming sugar addiction starts <a href=\"https://payhip.com/b/uBAs\">here!</a></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>You can not measure every bite that passes your lips.
