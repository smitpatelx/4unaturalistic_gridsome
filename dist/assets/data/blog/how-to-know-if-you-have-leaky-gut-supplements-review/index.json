It also helps combat diseases and pathogens due to the presence of barriers in the form of intestinal walls. Regulating the passage of substances into the general circulation.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tight junctions, which are tiny spaces in the walls of the intestine, allows the passage of nutrients and water. While they inhibit the passage of pathogens and other harmful substances. The intestine becomes permeable as it allows the easy passage of toxins through the wall.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The gut becomes more permeable when the junctions of the intestinal wall loosen. This facilitates the passage of bacteria and toxins from the gut into the general circulation. This phenomenon is what is referred to as &#8220;leaky gut syndrome&#8221;.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Leaky gut syndrome results in an inflammation of the entire system. In many cases, it triggers an immune system reaction.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Leaky gut can provoke an array of symptoms such as:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">food sensitivity,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">issues with digestion,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">skin problems,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">bloating and fatigue (</span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1856434\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">1</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">).</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It might also be the culprit of some of the major health conditions including migraines, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, thyroid issue and autism, skin conditions, and multiple sclerosis.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Very few scientific studies mention leaky gut. However, many medical professionals agree that hyper-permeability of the intestine does exist in some chronic diseases (<a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1856434\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1</a>, <a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2886850\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2</a>).</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What could be the cause of leaky gut syndrome?</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A leaky gut syndrome is some sort of medical mystery. Research is ongoing to determine what causes it.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Intestinal permeability is regulated by a protein known as Zonulin (</span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3458511/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">3</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"http://physrev.physiology.org/content/91/1/151\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">4</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">). When this protein is activated in genetically susceptible people, it then results in leaky gut. The two factors that trigger Zonulin release are gluten and intestinal bacteria (<a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21248165/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5</a>). </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Studies have shown that gluten only causes an increase in intestinal permeability in persons with irritable bowel syndrome and celiac disease (</span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16099460\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">6</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"http://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-9-23\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">7</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">).</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Several factors contribute to a leaky gut. These include:</span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">High intake of sugar; </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Diets high in sugar, especially fructose can alter the barrier function of the intestine.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Long term use of NSAIDs such as Ibuprofen can increase the permeability of the intestine, thus facilitating the leaky gut.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Excessive intake of alcohol;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Alcohol may increase the permeability of the gut. This has been proven scientifically (</span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4266989/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">8</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16565490/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">9</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">).</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Nutrient deficiencies;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Deficiencies in such nutrients as vitamin D, A, &amp; zinc have been implicated in intestinal permeability.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Poor gut health;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The gut is loaded with millions of bacteria. Some of these are beneficial to the system while many are not. There must be a balance between the two. A disruption of this balance can affect the structural integrity of the intestinal wall. This can lead to gut permeability (</span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4253991\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">10</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">).</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Symptoms of the leaky gut syndrome</span></h4>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2038\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2038\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2038\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/canstockphoto57688158-2.jpg\" alt=\"Food Allergies\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/canstockphoto57688158-2.jpg 800w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/canstockphoto57688158-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/canstockphoto57688158-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/canstockphoto57688158-2-391x260.jpg 391w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2038\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo / Zinkevych</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Food <a href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/the-truth-about-food-sensitivity-how-to-protect-your-gut/\">sensitivities</a></span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Because of the large number of toxins that enter the bloodstream, people with a leaky gut have an overdriven immune system. As their body produce many antibodies, which may increase the susceptibility to antigens in foods; such as gluten and dairy. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A study involving children and rats established a relationship between leaky gut syndrome and food sensitivities (</span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25543046\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">11</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23909601\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">12</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">). This is the most common symptom of a leaky gut syndrome.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Inflammatory bowel disease</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A 2012 study carried out by Hungarian researchers has shown that a hyperpermeable gut is most times localized to the large intestine of IBS patients and patients with ulcerative colitis (</span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/333083\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">13</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">). </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Scientists in 1988 suggested that people with a leaky gut have an increased risk of getting Crohn’s disease (</span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1434087\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">14</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">). A study has also shown that zinc supplementation may help treat tight junction dysfunction. There is a need for more research to verify these results (</span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11383597\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">15</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">).</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Autoimmune diseases</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Research on Zonulin is the key to understanding how gut permeability can cause autoimmune disease. Researchers from the University Of Maryland School Of Medicine did the discovery that gluten triggers Zonulin signaling; irrespective of the gene expression of autoimmunity. This results in excess permeability of the intestine to macromolecules (</span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16635908\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">16</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">). </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">However, what’s best is that just as leaky gut plays a role in autoimmune disorders, it is reversible; and has the potential to alleviate some of these immune disorders.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Thyroid malfunction: Hashimoto’s disease is one of the autoimmune disorders directly affected by the leaky gut syndrome. This disorder is associated with hypothyroidism, fatigue, impaired metabolism, increased weight, and other issues such as:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Inflammatory skin conditions</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Cravings for carbs, and sugars</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Depression, ADHD, and anxiety</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Joint pain or arthritis</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Skin rashes and other problems such as rosacea, eczema, and acne</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Memory loss, brain fog, and headaches</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The outcome of leaky gut</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Natural way that may help treat a leaky gut include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Special diets – gluten-free, antifungal diets and </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"http://www.lanaturolistica.community/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">low sugar diets</span></a></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">L-glutamine, probiotics and other nutritional supplements.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and stress reduction. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Patients should consult their physicians if they have concerns. The physician may help you identify any underlying health disorder; and/ or suggest lifestyle modifications that may help relieve your symptoms.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Natural treatment for leaky gut</span></h4>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2156\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2156\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2156\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/jakub-kapusnak-4f4YZfDMLeU-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/jakub-kapusnak-4f4YZfDMLeU-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/jakub-kapusnak-4f4YZfDMLeU-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/jakub-kapusnak-4f4YZfDMLeU-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2156\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Jakub Kapusnak on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Foods</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Some foods can help alleviate the symptoms of leaky gut. These foods aid in healing because they digest easily and also repair the intestinal linings. They include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bone broth:</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A bone broth meal contains essential amino acids and minerals such as glycine, proline, and potassium. These nutrients can help repair a leaky gut and supplement mineral deficiencies.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Raw cultured dairy:</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The gut can be healed by probiotic-rich foods such as yogurt, amasai, and kefir. These foods heal the gut by destroying pathogens such as candida. If you are lactose intolerant it&#8217;s best to consume </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"http://www.lanaturolistica.community/2019/02/coconut-milk-kefir-easy-homemade.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">coconut milk kefir.</span></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Fermented vegetables:</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Foods such as sauerkraut, kimchi, and kefir contain probiotics that help repair a leaky gut. They work by creating a balance between the stomach pH and pH of the small intestine.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Steamed veggies:</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Steamed or cooked vegetables are easy to digest and constitute an essential component of a leaky gut diet.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Healthy fats:</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Healthy fats can also promote the healing of a leaky gut. Foods with healthy fat content include salmon, avocados, and coconut oil, ghee and egg yolks.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Fruits:</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">One or two daily servings of fruits can help repair a leaky gut. Steamed apples and pears or homemade fruit sauce and applesauce are very beneficial. It is best to take the fruits in the morning and not late in the day. Also, fruit intake should be moderated.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Supplements for leaky gut syndrome</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Some of the important supplements that help with digestion and also protect the gut lining from extensive damage include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Probiotics </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> Probiotics and prebiotics can help repopulate your gut flora with friendly bacteria.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>L-glutamine powder</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Glutamine helps in the repair of the gastrointestinal tract. It is helpful for people with diarrhea.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Digestive enzymes </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Enzymes can facilitate the breakdown and absorption of foods in the gastrointestinal tract.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Aloe vera</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A daily intake of a ½ cup of aloe vera juice may help leaky gut. This should be taken three times daily. It heals the digestive system.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>FIsh oil</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Some practitioners suggest taking 1000mg of fish oil: DHA and EPA are essential fatty acids present in fish oil. They may help reduce inflammation.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Essential oils that may help heal the gut:</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ginger and peppermint essential oils can soothe the inflamed intestine; thus facilitating the healing of the leaky gut. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">2 drops of each oil should be mixed in a glass of water. </span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">3 drops of the essential oil should be mixed with coconut oil and rubbed over the abdominal region twice daily.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Other supplement that can help leaky gut diet are immunoglobulins. These immune proteins assist in arresting gut pathogens while supporting the immune function of the gut, and its barrier function.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Moderate movement (at least 4-5 miles of daily walking) stimulates the GI nerves, thus helping to maintain the motility of the gut. A lot of people lead sedentary lives. Such can contribute to the neurological retardation of gut function. It is advised that we move our bodies daily instead of sitting at a desk all day.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Foods that are not easily digestible should be avoided. Such include FODMAPS, beans, and dairy. Even though they may be gluten-free, they are very difficult to digest and may slow down the recovery of the GI.</span></p>\n<p>Finally, Omega-3 fatty acids may also help leaky gut syndrome. It does this by fighting inflammation. Studies have shown that omega-3 fatty acids have the potential to relieve the symptoms of IBS. Natural sources of Omega-3 are salmon, sardines, mackerel, and anchovies. Omega 3 is also available in supplemental form.</p>\n<h4>\nNotice</h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Information on this article is for educational purposes only.
