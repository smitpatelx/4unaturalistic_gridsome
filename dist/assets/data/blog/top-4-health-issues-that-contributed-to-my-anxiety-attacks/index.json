I remember being in my room and having a feeling of apprehension and terror. The fear that something unimaginable was going to happen. I was cold, however, I was sweating. It was so intense that my heart rate started to rise, and everything around me was falling apart. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Later, I was having all kinds of gut problems. Anything that affects the brain might have a connection with the gut. It has been proven that poor gut bacteria can cause mood problems and even depression. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">I was ashamed of talking to someone. When I turned sixteen, I was diagnosed with an ulcer. No medications brought relief to any of these things. So, I kept my struggle private. But it soon became overwhelming when I started university. The truth is I was dealing with so much stress that my body could no longer cope.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">I turned to writing and dancing. That helped me cope with my recurrent panic attacks.  </span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">My amazing discovery.</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">At twenty-four, I was having these panic attacks almost every day. I decided to fight back with food, and I tried all kind of diets. I saw a gastroenterologist, a counselor, and a spiritual advisor. I repeatedly visited my family doctor and gynecologist who told me that it was all in my head. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It all had to do with my blood sugar that was up and down because of my adrenals. Therefore, my adrenals glands were tired. it&#8217;s a vicious circle. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The adrenals glands can affect your thyroid, hormone function, and even mood.</span></p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The 4 contributors to my panic attacks</span></h4>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2187\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2187\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2187\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/daily-nouri-D37STEwmyqY-unsplash-1024x748.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"748\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/daily-nouri-D37STEwmyqY-unsplash-1024x748.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/daily-nouri-D37STEwmyqY-unsplash-300x219.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/daily-nouri-D37STEwmyqY-unsplash-768x561.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2187\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Daily Nouri on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Gut Problem</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Unbalance between good and bad bacteria can affect gut health. In that case, the presence of ulcer just reminds us here that bad bacteria are in control rather than the good ones. In my previous article,</span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://lanaturolistica.blog/2018/08/a-n%d0%b0tur%d0%b0l-a%d1%80%d1%80r%d0%be%d0%b0%d1%81h-that-may-treat-acid-r%d0%b5flux-and-ulcer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> A Nаturаl Aрprоaсh that May Treat Acid Rеflux and Ulcer</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, I talk about the bacteria H. pylori and ulcer.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As soon I found out that my emotions are one thing and my gut bacteria are another thing, I started to take care of my gut. I did a gut repair program. You don’t need a degree to know that once the bad guys are in control there can’t be peace. With the help of my family, we started an anti-inflammatory living.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The anti-inflammatory living</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Eating healthy was the goal, not just a diet that fits everyone but something that provides your body what it needs. The most important thing to succeed in an <a href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/how-to-shop-for-an-anti-inflammatory-diet/\">anti-inflammatory living</a> is to remove everything that does not serve a purpose in your diet. The foods, that you’re probably sensitive to. Get rid of processed and dead foods and start eating fresh and colorful food.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">I have a saying: “If it doesn’t come from a plant, a tree, the ground, or the ocean, nature in general then it is not food”. If you can’t read it or don’t know what it is, then don&#8217;t eat it. Avoid what can increase inflammation in your gut as much as you can.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Drink lots of alkaline water.</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Water helps with digestion, inflammation, weight loss, pain, and fatigue. People who are not trained to drink enough water have a higher risk of getting sick. Dehydration can cause tiredness, joint pain, and even kidney problems.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Nourish your gut with good bacteria that come from healthy foods.</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">These fermented foods contain lots of probiotics: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kefir</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Yogurt (if not lactose intolerant)</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kimchi</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Saurkraut</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Mabi, a Caribbean beverage</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kombucha</span></li>\n<li><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"http://www.lanaturolistica.community/2019/02/coconut-milk-kefir-easy-homemade.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Coconut kefir</span></a></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Fermented cashew</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Miso</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tempeh</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Or you can just take a probiotic supplement. In my previous article: </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://lanaturolistica.blog/2018/11/dont-buy-another-probiotics-supplement-before-reading-this/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">“Don’t Buy Another Probiotic Supplement Before Reading This,”</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> I listed the top 5 most important information about probiotic supplements. </span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">High Sugar Consumption</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Before demonizing sugar, we should know that there are two kinds of sugars, the ones that kill and the ones that are kind of healthy. Natural sugars are found in nature and whole foods such as:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> fruits of all kinds and certain vegetables, </span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">honey, </span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">sugar cane, </span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">molasses, </span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and maple syrup. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Nothing is removed and nothing is added. Table sugar comes from various sources, it is made of glucose and fructose. It is processed and refined. </span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">While a little bit of natural sugar is fine; refined sugar is deadly as it can cause: </span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">the onset of diabetes;</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">blurred vision; </span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">weight gain; </span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">hormonal imbalance; </span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">fatigue; </span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">inflammation; </span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and pain and digestive problems. It also feeds certain ailments like cancer.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What does sugar have to do with panic attacks?</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">I paid attention; when I was not eating well I had symptoms of sugar imbalance. I felt nervous, dizzy, moody, and tired. Later on, anxiety and panic attacks would follow. </span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A roller coaster</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sugar imbalance is like a roller coaster. After you eat foods that are high in simple carbs and sugar, blood glucose level rises. If it rises too fast, the body releases too much insulin; which is the hormone that regulates blood sugar. That can cause blood sugar to decrease again. It can create an imbalance and causing all the symptoms.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Adrenal Fatigue</span></h4>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2188\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2188\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2188\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/davidcohen-qghuLqyh3nE-unsplash-1024x810.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"810\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/davidcohen-qghuLqyh3nE-unsplash-1024x810.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/davidcohen-qghuLqyh3nE-unsplash-300x237.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/davidcohen-qghuLqyh3nE-unsplash-768x608.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2188\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by DAVIDCOHEN on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">After correcting my diet and stop consuming refined sugar I was still prone to panic attacks, so I furthered my research. The sugar imbalance and poor diet affected my thyroid glands and adrenals. </span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The adrenal gland</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">They are two tiny glands situated above the kidneys, they produce and release certain regulatory hormones and chemical messengers. They manufacture adrenaline as well as cortisol, commonly called hydrocortisone. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Adrenaline and cortisol, along with other similar hormones, can help control body fluid balance; as well as blood pressure, blood sugar, and other central metabolic functions. However, being unable to relax, constant stress, and having a poor nutrition can weaken the adrenal glands. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As they are in the front line, therefore, they can get atrophied and even impair the function of the thyroid gland. Not good news, right! </span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Best supplement for the adrenals:</span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">B complex;</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Vitamin C; and </span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">E;</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Borage; </span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and Ashwagandha.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Lymphatic Build-Up</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">We are living in a highly toxic world. The adage that our body can clean up itself like an engine no longer stands. Lack of exercise, poor foods choice, emotional clutter and too much stress as well too many chemicals can cause clogging of the lymphatic system.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The lymphatic system is a network of organs and tissue whose job is to help rid the body of toxins. Not being able to remove toxins is very bad for each detoxification system. </span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In that case, the liver suffers greatly and starts to under-perform, affecting blood sugar and causing more stress. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As it is a part of the immune system, which is mainly in the gut; so, health starts with the gut. </span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Four simple habits that can help with panic attacks:</span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Eat a balanced diet; and drink alkaline water to ease digestion and regulate blood sugar.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Do</span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"http://www.bernardjensen.com/Skin-Brushing_ep_55-1.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> skin brushing</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> to eliminate lymphatic toxicity.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Exercise and meditate to stay active.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Stay positive and do things that you enjoy doing.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">I am panic- attack free for years now, and I want you to be free too.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Cheers!</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> </span></p>\n<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Reference</span></strong></h4>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sporn, A.
