You feel the need to\nchange everything that does not serve a purpose in your diet, you\ngather as much information as you can to start an anti-inflammatory\nlifestyle. But what happens next?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you are a\nbeginner or an expert in anti-inflammatory living, one thing remains\nclear, you need a great plan, a plan that actually works. There is\nnothing worse than starting a clean lifestyle and not knowing what to\ndo. I had the same problem getting information and trying to adjust\nthem to my lifestyle. I&#8217;m a busy natural health educator who works 6\ndays a week and spends the rest of the time running from one errand\nto another. My schedule can be hectic, so I made plans. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we\nwill explore how to effortlessly shop for an anti-inflammatory sugar\ncleanse lifestyle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>                                       \n  &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gone are the days\nwhen you would go to a shopping place and not know what to buy.\nBefore you start you need to elaborate a simple plan. But before the\nplan you need to master your life, the struggle is real.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Before You Shop</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is very difficult to go shopping on workdays or when you have a lot of chores, having to work and do chores can get you exhausted and make your shopping experience a complete nightmare. Furthermore, you will rush things, making you even more tired.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, my first\nrecommendation is to create a schedule. Now, you are probably\nthinking that you can shop anytime and having a schedule doesn’t\nfit your lifestyle. But like any other job you have to create time.\nBut how?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>7 ways you can save time:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/onesave-day-jDU0rBl9_mk-unsplash-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"2599\" data-full-url=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/onesave-day-jDU0rBl9_mk-unsplash-scaled.jpg\" data-link=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/?attachment_id=2599\" class=\"wp-image-2599\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/onesave-day-jDU0rBl9_mk-unsplash-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/onesave-day-jDU0rBl9_mk-unsplash-225x300.jpg 225w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/onesave-day-jDU0rBl9_mk-unsplash-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/onesave-day-jDU0rBl9_mk-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-item__caption\">  Photo by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@onesaveaday?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">OneSave/Day</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/apps?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a>  </figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Social media</strong> </h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Be less present on\nsocial media; social media can be overwhelming. It is estimated that\nthe average individual in North America with access to a smart-phone\nspends at least 2 hours a day on social media. Unfortunately, this\nhabit can make you less creative, leaving you with no time to prepare\nfor other activities in life. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Spend less time stressing about things from the past</strong> </h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people tend to\nfocus on daily stress and what happened in the past. This is one\nhabit to kill as it stops you from being productive in the present. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Weekend shopping</strong> </h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Start your shopping trip on weekends or your day off if you have a full-time job. Unhealthy people tend to take a trip to their favorite store after work, making them want to buy comfort foods, especially if they don&#8217;t enjoy their job.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Less talking, more doing</strong> </h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have family\nor friends over, you can invite them to shop with you; of course,\neach will have to spend on their own stuff. It is fun to talk and\nshop for food as you would do for clothes. If you are not a\nshopper-talker, then enjoy it alone. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Online watch party or get together</strong> </h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have to spend\na lot of time on social media, make it fun and productive; let time\nwork for you. So, instead of getting caught in the day to day drama\nof others, you can create a secret group for anti-inflammatory living\nto share recipes and shopping ideas. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Make it simple</strong> </h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people are\nperfectionists who want to give the illusion of a perfect life. Stop\nthis habit, it will force you to give up on eating healthy once you\nrealize that perfection cannot be attained. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Finally, get a <strong>Food Journal</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In one of my videos posted last week: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfIGan2ndZs\">&#8220;How to plan for a sugar cleanse: 5 Tips to helping you succeed&#8221;;</a> I mentioned how important it is to plan and get a calendar. I also recommended a food journal, whether it is online or in print. What can a food journal help you with?</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li> A journal keeps you on schedule. </li><li> It helps you track the high consumption of empty calories. </li><li> It can help you pinpoint any reaction after food such as <a href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/the-truth-about-food-sensitivity-how-to-protect-your-gut/\">food sensitivity. </a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>You can watch my video,<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfIGan2ndZs\"> &#8220;How to plan for a sugar cleanse: 5 Tips to helping you succeed&#8221;,</a> to get great tips and information about food journals, saving time, and kitchen tools.  </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Make a plan:\ncreate a list.</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Notebook-Lines-Teacher-Appreciation-Blog-Graphic-2-683x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2593\" width=\"455\" height=\"679\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you are\nready, let&#8217;s create the list. I honestly can shop off the top of my\nhead and create awesome recipes without even looking at a cookbook.\nBut it&#8217;s actually an acquired skill that most people can learn. Until\nthen, if you are not comfortable doing so, I recommend you create an\nitemized list. You can either write it down or create it online. You\ncan also download it for free by subscribing to my blog. That way you\nget full access to all I&#8217;m saying right now. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I absolutely provide one with the sugar cleanse but it’s best to find out what works for you and create your own. You can be inspired by many other authors who provide a <a href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/10-health-hacks-that-anyone-can-do/\">meal plan</a> and create from there, this is how I create mine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Make a category:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important thing to do is to separate what you will need every month from what you will need every week or every two weeks. Depending on what you are buying and for how many people. Then, list all the items that you can buy in bulk and all the ones that you will have to buy regularly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Weekly Items</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li> Fruits  </li><li> Veggies  </li><li> Eggs  </li><li> Also, if you are not lactose intolerant, goat or buffalo milk are absolutely on the weekly or bi-weekly items.</li><li> Sometimes fish and meat can be a part of the weekly or bi-weekly list if you don&#8217;t have a huge freezer. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Bulk/Monthly\nItems</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li> Sprouted Grains (if you can have them)</li><li> Nuts  </li><li> Seeds  </li><li> Condiments, and so on.  These items can be stored; with the help of recycled or glass containers.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Then, I finish by\nmaking</strong><strong> subcategories</strong><strong>.\n</strong>\n</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Subcategories can help you remember what you need for a recipe; how much and/ or how many to buy weekly and monthly.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if you use:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>cups, </li><li>lb or kg;</li><li>OZ or L. </li><li>Except for dry spices that are measured in spoons or teaspoons, a sprinkle or a dash. Always look for backups and use the measurement system that works for you. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Subcategory:</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li> Fruits and vegetables; </li><li> Root vegetables; </li><li> Sprouted and ancient grains;</li><li> Peas;  </li><li> Nuts and seeds; </li><li> Egg, meat, and fish; </li><li>Oils; </li><li> Spice; </li><li> Nut butter; </li><li> Snacks, such as protein bars and coconut chips; </li><li> Baking items; and so on. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, you have what you need. The last tip is to save this list and plan for later. I actually take a picture or save it on my phone, so I can access it anytime and don&#8217;t have to re-create it from scratch. You can add and/ or remove some items and so on. You can also draw some inspiration in my article, <a href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/how-to-shop-for-an-anti-inflammatory-diet/\">&#8220;How to Shop for an Anti-inflammatory Diet&#8221;.  </a></p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Make time for your wellbeing before your grocery trip:</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>Reboot your life: Zen</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I know it sounds\nvery guru-like, but it is a healthy and simple habit. The first thing\nto do is to create a sacred space and dedicate it to your well being.\nI took the habit to personalize my workplace and my home. A sacred\nspace can give you a time to be with yourself and by yourself without\nfeeling anxious. In your mind, you should dedicate it to such\npurpose, so being in that place will make you feel at peace. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, whether you live in a big flat, by yourself or with other people, you need a space to center yourself. It can be the backyard, the porch, the living room; if you live in a tiny apartment it can be the bedroom or even your bed. I am giving you all the options so you don&#8217;t fail this.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Let it flow</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Kimberly, one of our bloggers, in her article <a href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/how-to-incorporate-self-care-into-your-daily-life-for-improved-mental-health/\">&#8220;How to Incorporate Self-Care into Your Daily Life for Improved Mental Health&#8221;</a> made some great recommendations about taking care of oneself while living healthy.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you become aware of your surroundings and become comfortable with yourself, then you are more in control of your emotions and let things flow in your life. Once the situation becomes stressful and you feel that you can&#8217;t handle it, take a step back and relax.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Get a feel-good app.</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Technology is often depicted as bad, but it can be handy. Why not use it the right way and get everything we need from it. I came across a feel-good app when I went through my gut issues. Since then I started creating time for myself, and it became a habit. If it&#8217;s too much and you are new to being by yourself and meditating, a <a href=\"https://app.www.calm.com/\">feel-good app</a> can help you make healthy changes and create healthy habits. It becomes a reminder to take time for yourself. It&#8217;s like having a personal coach at your fingertip, I am a big fan. There are lots of options out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Final Thought</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>These tips are for\nyour life, not just a sugar cleanse or an anti-inflammatory living.\nAs you learn and proceed you can make personalized changes, and peace\nwill come almost immediately after mastering it. Actually, a clean\neating plan leaves you very little time to think about the past and\nworry about the future. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my next article,\nwe will be exploring how to save money on the sugar cleanse. \n</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>So, you know by now that sugar is bad for you.
