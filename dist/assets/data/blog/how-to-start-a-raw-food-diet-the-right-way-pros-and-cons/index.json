These are part of a raw food diet menu. Other staples are fermented foods, young coconut milk, and sundried fruits. Your choice of foods may depend on your reasons for dieting, for example:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">sprouted brown rice slows glucose absorption and improves the metabolism</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">cabbage supports healthy cellular function; radish leaves act as an anti-oxidant, as does Shitake mushroom</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">carrots are a great source of vitamin A as well as encouraging healthy vision and a healthy cardiovascular system</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You can use a sprouter such as the Easy Green automatic sprouter to sprout seeds, grains, beans – even wheatgrass.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Health benefits of sprouts;</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sprouts could be called a <a href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/how-to-use-this-unique-superfood-to-fight-inflammation/\">‘superfood’</a> – organic sprouts contain enormous levels of:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">proteins,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">vitamins and minerals,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">trace minerals,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">chlorophyll pigments,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and enzymes,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and are the ideal natural supplement.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sprouts can be used in salads and soups or can be juiced.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Foods that are not on the menu:</span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">cooked foods,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">refined and processed foods,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">sugar,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and caffeine,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">as well as processed oils.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Anti-inflammatory juicing recipe:</span></h4>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2367\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2367\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2367\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/raspopova-marina-cn5V13Gry48-unsplash-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/raspopova-marina-cn5V13Gry48-unsplash-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/raspopova-marina-cn5V13Gry48-unsplash-150x150.jpg 150w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/raspopova-marina-cn5V13Gry48-unsplash-300x300.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/raspopova-marina-cn5V13Gry48-unsplash-768x768.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2367\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Raspopova Marina on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A great juicing recipe to complement a raw food diet is carrot juice with potato, fennel, and apple.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Simply juice 4 medium carrots,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">2 apples,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">1 small potato</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and 1 small stalk of fennel.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Fennel has been shown to reduce and control inflammation of arthritis, it evens mood fluctuation and depressive states and has the rare nutrient called manganese, plus zinc and vitamin B complex.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The nutritional value of grains and seeds is incredible. They contain most of the vitamins – particularly A, B, and E; and unsaturated fatty acids and lecithin, as well as being an excellent source of proteins.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Dairy alternatives:</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you are menopausal then boosting your estrogen level with soy is an excellent idea. You can even use soy makers (such as SoyQuick) to make non-dairy drinks from different sources such as:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">rice,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">nuts and seeds,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and grains to have with breakfast.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you want something a little bit thicker than soy and nut milk, that you can use in your raw deserts then use tofu. Tofu is full of health benefits; however make sure to buy organic, non- GMO soy products. I have outlined the top delicious dairy alternatives in my article: <a href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/how-to-live-lactose-free-by-using-delicious-alternatives/\">&#8220;</a></span>How to Live Lactose-Free by Using Delicious Alternatives&#8221;.</p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Raw food prep:</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Essentially, the idea of a raw food diet is to eat unprocessed foods for at least 75% of the time. If the idea of raw food isn’t very appetizing to you, you can warm the food a little as long as the food isn’t heated above 116°F. We are talking about:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Fruits and veggies: are juiced and used to make smoothies; you can even sundry.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Nuts: are soaked overnight.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Grains and some beans: are also soaked.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Detox reaction:</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Because a raw food diet is detoxifying some people suffer a mild detox reaction including mild headaches, nausea, and cravings. These symptoms may last for several days and you’ll get more enjoyment out of your raw food diet if you cut down on things like meat, sugar, and caffeine a week or so before commencing the diet.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Prep time:</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A raw food diet is certainly a good way to improve your overall health and wellbeing. Like anything worthwhile, it takes time, energy and commitment. Because many of the foods for this particular type of diet are made from scratch there is some preparation time involved. There are many great products on the market that can help you prepare your own living food and save you some time as well. The best thing to do is to subscribe to a meal prep community. </span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The cons of a raw food diet:</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">While it can help with all those health issues mentioned above; prolonged use might be detrimental to health and causing:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">digestive problems;</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and toxicity; as cooking kills off bacteria and toxins. A diet consisting of raw meat, eggs, and even certain beans and grains is toxic;</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">a raw vegan might be at risk of not getting enough nutrients.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A raw food diet should be considered by overweight individuals that are facing inflammatory conditions. </span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Best supplements to support the elimination process:</span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/dont-buy-another-probiotics-supplement-before-reading-this/\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">probiotics,</span></a></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">multi-vitamins,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">greens,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">fermented mushrooms,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and proteolytic digestive enzymes. Especially if you are prone to digestive issues. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Final thought</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A raw food diet is not supposed to be a cure-all; it has to be used in conjunction with regular exercise to see the maximum results. Make sure to drink adequate alkaline water to minimize the detoxing effects. Keep a journal of gratitude and do some fun things while doing a raw food diet and any diet for instance. No diet is meant to be one size fits all; find what works for you. </span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Caution:</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As with any major change in diet, it’s a wise idea to consult your doctor before beginning a special diet. This is especially true for children, pregnant women, anyone with anemia and anyone with a pre-existing medical condition.</span></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>We need clean, fresh foods full of antioxidants to feel energized.
