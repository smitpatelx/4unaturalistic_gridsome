You’re rushed to eat on the go, and never have anything healthy on hand. You’re unhappy at work and feel like you are no longer heard or valued. The stress-eating associated with this tense work environment has started to show. Your kids all have a different extracurriculars at the same time. You feel like you’ve been in the car for two hours, and fast food is becoming the most convenient option.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to make healthy choices when your day is packed, complicated, or stressed. They simply seem too hard — or too much of a luxury — but that attitude is a slippery slope. Soon, you’ll find yourself trapped in unhealthy patterns. Switching to a healthy lifestyle isn’t always easy, but it doesn’t have to be hard. Here are 10 health hacks anyone can do at any time.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h4>Take Care of Your Skin</h4>\n<p>Your skin is your largest organ, and in many ways, it’s the most vulnerable. Keep is protected, moisturized, and conditioned to keep away spots, wrinkles, and other damage — even skin cancer. Add in one <span lang=\"zxx\"><a href=\"https://www.angieslist.com/articles/soothing-hacks-restful-spa-day-home.htm\">skin protection routine</a></span> to your morning and evening routine, such as using an extra moisturizer, getting a hot shower, or wearing a cleansing mask.</p>\n<h4>Make Exercise Fun</h4>\n<p>You are more likely to keep up with exercise if you look forward to it. Don’t force yourself to start running or going to the gym if you know you’re going to hate it. Try dance lessons for cardio, indoor rock climbing for strength training, or kayaking for cross training.</p>\n<h4>Get Social and Sweaty</h4>\n<p>Working out with a friend can have a major impact on achieving fitness goals. This is essential because of <span lang=\"zxx\"><a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/peer-pressure-has-a-positive-side/\">peer pressure</a></span> — someone else is watching you and relying on you. Jogging together, weightlifting, or going to yoga — these are all ways to stay motivated to exercise.</p>\n<h4>Replace One Bad Food at a Time</h4>\n<p>For a few weeks, write down what you’re eating. Once you see what you commonly eat, you can decide what needs to go. Start small; don’t try to eliminate everything at once. Replace chips with carrots and grapes, or swap sandwiches for salads with homemade dressing. Try to work in more fruits and vegetables as you slowly let go of processed foods and refined grains.</p>\n<h4>Meal Prep Once a Week</h4>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2044\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2044\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-2044 size-large\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ella-olsson-P4jRJYN33wE-unsplash-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ella-olsson-P4jRJYN33wE-unsplash-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ella-olsson-P4jRJYN33wE-unsplash-300x225.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ella-olsson-P4jRJYN33wE-unsplash-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2044\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Ella Olsson on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><span lang=\"zxx\"><a href=\"http://www.mealprephaven.com/blog-1/2015/9/21/meal-prepping-101-for-beginners\">Meal prep</a></span> is an easy way for busy people to always have quick, easy access to healthy meals and snacks every day. You spend two to three hours one day a week (usually on the weekend or day off) to cook and store all your meals for the week — this saves both time and calories. If grocery shopping for home cooked meals takes too much time, get <span lang=\"zxx\"><a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-grocery-delivery-apps\">groceries delivered</a></span> to your door from services like Instacart, Shipt, Clicklist, or Amazon Prime.</p>\n<h4>Keep a Food Journal</h4>\n<p>Waiting to see the scale go down? Keep a <span lang=\"zxx\"><a href=\"https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/healthy-eating/keep-food-journal\">food journal</a></span> to become more aware of the foods you are eating and why you’re eating them. Jot down what you had at each meal, along with how you feel emotionally while you are eating. A food journal can reveal unhealthy patterns and emotional associations with food. You’ll be able to recognize that you are turning to food because you are bored, stressed, or sad, and you’ll have the opportunity to make changes.</p>\n<h4>Meditate to Improve Metabolism</h4>\n<p>Managing stress has a direct impact on weight loss. Just as little as 10 to 20 minutes of meditation a day has been shown to make an almost immediate impact on depression, high blood pressure, anxiety, mood, chronic pain, and memory. By cultivating this kind of mindfulness, you become more mindful in other ways — like the food choices you make. And a regular meditation practice can actually <span lang=\"zxx\"><a href=\"https://www.innerhealthstudio.com/meditation-for-pain-relief.html\">heal</a></span> mental and physical pain. You can follow videos on YouTube or download a free app on your phone, such as Calm, Insight Time, or Headspace.</p>\n<h4>Start Scheduling Self-Care</h4>\n<p>Self-care activities are often the first cut from the day. It’s not fair to your overall well-being to put off your own needs. The rest of your life will suffer— you can get <span lang=\"zxx\"><a href=\"https://www.inc.com/jory-mackay/3-symptoms-of-burnout-you-might-not-recognize-and.html\">burnout</a></span> at work, unsympathetic to your partner, or resentful of your loved ones. Start your day out with something just for you — enjoying coffee alone on your patio, practicing yoga, or relaxing in the tub. If possible, try to avoid your phone until after your <span lang=\"zxx\"><a href=\"http://www.thelawofattraction.com/self-care-tips/\">self-care</a></span> activity. Then, once a week or at least every two, schedule a longer activity, like a manicure, massage, or trip to a museum.</p>\n<h4>Start a New Healthy Hobby</h4>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2045\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2045\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-2045 size-large\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/danielle-cerullo-3ckWUnaCxzc-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/danielle-cerullo-3ckWUnaCxzc-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/danielle-cerullo-3ckWUnaCxzc-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/danielle-cerullo-3ckWUnaCxzc-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/danielle-cerullo-3ckWUnaCxzc-unsplash-391x260.jpg 391w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2045\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Danielle Cerullo on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Try on a <span lang=\"zxx\"><a href=\"https://www.aplaceformom.com/blog/6-13-16-health-hobbies-for-seniors/\">new hobby</a></span> to broaden your experience with healthy lifestyles. Grab a friend or go on a solo adventure by taking dancing lessons or joining an adult recreational team sport. Start walking during your lunch break with co-workers. Or, walk on your own while listening to music or a new podcast. There are a lot of opportunities out there — searching on Google, Facebook, and Meetup.com usually provides some unique and fun results.</p>\n<h4>Multitask Exercise and Life</h4>\n<p>Squeezing in a full hour a day of exercise can be hard for people on a tight schedule. That’s where adding an element of fitness to other activities can help. Purchase a treadmill desk for your office. Take all your meetings and phone calls while walking. Do a 30-minute <span lang=\"zxx\"><a href=\"https://fitbodybuzz.com/hiit-workouts-at-home/\">HIIT workout at home</a></span> while watching the news or your favorite TV show. Warm up with 100 jumping jacks before you take a shower and cool down with some slow, stretchy yoga at the end of your day.</p>\n<p>Your health matters. With <span lang=\"zxx\"><a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/282929.php\">heart disease</a></span> the leading cause of death among Americans, we have to pay more attention to food and activities that protect and heal us. Poor diet, lack of exercise, and loads of stress all damage the heart and cardiovascular system. Even the smallest healthy changes — like eating less fast food or making time for self-care — make a huge difference.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Read next:</p>\n<h4 class=\"single-post-title entry-title\"><a href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/living-with-chronic-pain-tips-for-your-best-life/\">&#8220;Living with Chronic Pain: Tips for Your Best Life&#8221;.</a></h4>\n","excerpt":"<p>You’ve got work, then class, then homework.
