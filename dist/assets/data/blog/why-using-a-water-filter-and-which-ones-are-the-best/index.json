To understand the concept it is best to use a chart of 0- 14. Anything that falls under 7 is acidic; while 7 is considered neutral. Any number higher than 7 is alkaline. Your body has to be slightly alkaline at about 7.35 to 7.45.</p>\n<p>Contrarily to your stomach lining and the vaginal tract for women. Alkalinity is very important because it stops acid from forming in our body and tissue. When the body is alkaline it is strong and builds resistance against any diseases. You got to make sure that your water contains the alkalized minerals at all time.</p>\n<h4>How to choose a water filter that fits your need?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A good water filter should remove the harmful bacteria, lower or remove the toxic chemicals existent or added and keep or add alkaline minerals that are good for overall health. A good water filter should offer the mentioned above without costing you the extraordinary price that other filters will.</li>\n<li>To make it simpler, many water filters are hard to install so, if the process of installing is too costly you can buy a countertop water filter. One that gives great results.</li>\n<li>Now, most will think that reverse osmosis is best. You are not entirely wrong but there is a catch. If the minerals are not added back in your reverse osmosis water there is big chance that you might end up with many minerals deficiency as well as leeching of many nutrients out of your system that can be detrimental. The process of mineralization give your water a better and fresher taste; it also contains more than 50 trace minerals that are absolutely great for bones, teeth and general health!</li>\n<li>At home, filtered and clean water can be enjoyed all day long; as for the ones who have to work or leave the house they can carry a glass or stainless steel bottle. No additional utilization of plastic bottles. Hence, this technique works for many others and for me at the fraction of the value of plastic bottles, this is the way that mother nature meant for the world.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Tip:</h4>\n<blockquote><p>When I travel, I use an alkaline water stick to raise the water pH, it also adds minerals and filters chlorine. That way I can always carry my personalized glass bottle with me (my glass bottle did not cost me a dime from being recycled); and I prefer the <a href=\"https://www.santevia.com/\">Santevia</a> Power sticks.</p></blockquote>\n<h4><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-606 size-large\" src=\"https://lanaturolistica.blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/devin-avery-539934-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"432\" />Water and your health</h4>\n<p>Water is important at all times.
