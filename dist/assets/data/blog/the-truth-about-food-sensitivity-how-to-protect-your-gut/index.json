However, we might eliminate all the bad stuff such as refined, processed, and sugary foods from our diet and still have digestive, hormonal, and mood problems.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">You might be asking how this is possible, that means even the good stuff might be bad for you, let me explain this. The gassy, bloated, and fatigued feeling that you feel at least one hour after a meal for no apparent reason is the first indication. However, there are many more such as experiencing a sudden sadness, depression, and nose or rectal itching that last for days after consuming such meals. All these symptoms might cause a frequent visit to multiple practitioners with no results. The symptoms can vary, making it impossible for you to understand. </span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">If you have any of the above symptoms, you might have a food sensitivity. Keep reading, it&#8217;s going to get good at the end.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><!--more--></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">In food sensitivity, the symptoms are so evasive that people have a hard time identifying the issue and might actually start to think it’s all in their head. Well, if that&#8217;s the case you are not alone, there are many people out there who are going through the same situation. But before getting ahead to give helpful hints and tips on how to find out about one&#8217;s food sensitivities; let&#8217;s take a short time to understand what food sensitivity is. </span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">There are ways to find out and be healthy again, and this is what I am going to share with you today. </span></p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">What is the Difference Between Food Allergy and Food Sensitivity? </span></h4>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Allergies come from different sources, it could be airborne, pollen, cat&#8217;s fur, or even food. It has been estimated that 1 in 3 individuals have an allergy of some sort and food allergy is one of the most common. </span><span lang=\"en-CA\">Food allergies are pretty easy to spot though as dramatic reactions are activated immediately after ingesting the food in question.</span></p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Difference Between Actual Allergies and Food Sensitivity</span></h4>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2036\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2036\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-2036 size-full\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/canstockphoto18425556-1.jpg\" alt=\"Elimination diet\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/canstockphoto18425556-1.jpg 800w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/canstockphoto18425556-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/canstockphoto18425556-1-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2036\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Elimination Diet</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1391 size-full\" src=\"https://lanaturolistica.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/canstockphoto57688158.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" /></p>\n<h4></h4>\n<h4>Food Allergy Cause:</h4>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">During a food allergy, the immune system is involved. The immune system releases markers against certain substances that it doesn&#8217;t trust. These classic markers are antibodies IgE. For example, people with peanut allergies can go into anaphylactic shock, a fatal condition that causes </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">trouble breathing, </span></li>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">severe drop in blood pressure, </span></li>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">dizziness,</span></li>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\"> itching, </span></li>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">swelling, </span></li>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">and hives. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">However, not all allergies are IgE related. That&#8217;s what brings us to food intolerance commonly called food sensitivity.</span></p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-GB\">Food Sensitivity Causes:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">First of all, in food intolerance, the person might lack certain enzymes to digest a particular food; such as the case of people that are lactose intolerant. Or people that are celiac and have a reaction to gluten, a protein in wheat. </span></li>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">In certain cases, the person might have a sensitivity to the additives and coloring of certain foods. Other substances are amine in fermented foods, MSG, and salicylates in fruits, spices, and beverages among others. </span></li>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">It might be histamine toxicity. Such toxicity occurs in situations where tuna and mackerel are not refrigerated properly. The bacteria might contain higher levels of histamine that can provoke allergy-like symptoms similar to food poisoning.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">In food sensitivity, IgG complex antibodies are involved. Food sensitivity is one of the subjects that people pay the least attention to, it doesn&#8217;t sound so scary after all, does it? Because of this people might suffer later from unwanted gut problems such as <a href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/how-to-know-if-you-have-leaky-gut-5-essential-supplements-to-protect-the-gut-lining/\">leaky gut syndrome</a> and other gut disorders.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">While food allergies cause an immediate response to foods, food sensitivity is delayed and might take up to 72 hours to show up. Research has shown that some cases might take up to a month to appear. In certain cases, food sensitivities can become chronic. </span></p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">The Main Symptoms Caused by Food Sensitivities Involve:</span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">digestive gastrointestinal complaints,</span></li>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">acid reflux, </span></li>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">skin issues such as pimples and even acne, </span></li>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">migraine and headache, </span></li>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">swollen joint and joint pain,</span></li>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">nasal discharge, </span></li>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">itchy eyes, nose, and/ or rectum,</span></li>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">mood problems, </span></li>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">hormonal imbalance and PMS,</span></li>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">weight gain, </span></li>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">adrenal fatigue, </span></li>\n<li lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">trouble sleeping </span>and so on.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">How to Know if You Have Food Sensitivity</span></h4>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">The gut is like a second brain; many experts and practitioners are finding out how amazing the gut is, which makes it pretty comparable to the brain. From controlling your digestion to your mood, your gut does it all. That&#8217;s why we see that many individuals with gut issues end up with <a href=\"https://lanaturolistica.blog/2019/01/the-top-4-health-issues-that-contributed-to-my-panic-attacks-my-healing-story/\">mood problems</a> as it affects the feel-good hormones.</span></p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">How Does it Affect you Emotionally? </span></h4>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">One of the first things that we notice in people with food sensitivity is a stubborn persistence. Sometimes persistence occurs due to the person wanting to keep eating such foods thinking it&#8217;s healthy for them when actually the food in question is doing more harm than good. People with food sensitivity have a strong urge for food that can hurt them.</span></p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-GB\">Craving certain foods</h4>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Craving from food sensitivity is very different from pica. Pica occurs mostly in pregnant women. It also differs from the craving caused by nutritional deficiencies where the body is craving food that contains the nutrients it needs. This specific type of craving is mainly like an addiction. The first thing that the person will notice is an irritable feeling until they eat the particular food they are craving for. While eating such food a feeling of euphoria and short-lived well-being may settle.</span></p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-GB\">Difference between crave and food sensitivities</h4>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">The same way an addict cannot stop the substance that he is addicted to, a person with a food sensitivity not only suffers from some or all the symptoms mentioned above, but they can also get emotional. They tend to get moody or irritable if the ingestion of such food does not take place. Most of the symptoms mentioned above start appearing after 72 hours of ingestion the culprit(s).</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Because food sensitivity can provoke so many symptoms, it can be difficult to diagnose. So, once a practitioner suspects that food sensitivity is involved they might send for an IgG test to test for the protein in the food.</span></p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Food Allergy Tests in Conventional Medicine</span></h4>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-1392 size-large\" src=\"https://lanaturolistica.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hush-naidoo-1170844-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"432\" /></p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">1. The Pricking Test</span></h4>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Usually done by allergists, a small drop of the substance is placed on the patient’s arm or back then pricked with a special needle to allow the absorption of the allergen. Once reaction occurs then the allergist determines whether the person is sensitive to such food. </span></p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">2. Blood Test</span></h4>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">An allergen is mixed with the patient’s blood sample, causing the immune system to make antibodies called IgE. The amount of IgE can help an allergist determine whether a person is allergic to such food. This test while accurate only involves some allergens, not all.</span></p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">3. An Oral Food Allergy Test</span></h4>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">At timed intervals, the allergist gives a high amount of the food in question to the patient. Severe reactions can occur that will help determine whether the person is allergic to such food. It must be noted that in many places the </span><span lang=\"en-CA\">Oral Food Allergy Test </span><span lang=\"en-CA\">may not be available.</span></p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Best Alternative Way to Check Your Food Sensitivities</span></h4>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Alternative holistic practitioners may use muscle testing and hair testing. A well as the IGg blood test or immunoglobulin test usually recommended by Naturopath. It helps figure the food an individual is sensitive to, so it can be removed from their diet. A protocol is put in place to help rebuild the gut lining.</span></p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Do it Yourself</span></h4>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">However, if you don&#8217;t have access to the listed tests, there are ways that you can test yourself at home.</span></p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-GB\">•<span lang=\"en-CA\"> The Pulse Test</span></h4>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Being sensitive to food can cause an increased pulse rate immediately after eating such foods. This test can be done in the comfort of your house. </span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Sit and wait for your pulse to be rested, then chew a piece of the food that you want to test and wait for 30 seconds (don&#8217;t swallow). Test your pulse again for one full minute. Do not swallow the food, just spit it out. Write down the name of the tested food and your pulse result. Rinse your mouth properly and repeat the same process for the rest of the food you want to test. If your pulse rises 6 points or higher, then you’re likely sensitive or allergic to the food. If your pulse rises lower than 6 points or did not rise at all, then you probably don&#8217;t have a sensitivity or allergy to that food.</span></p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-GB\">•<span lang=\"en-CA\"> The Blood Pressure Check</span></h4>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">The blood pressure check is another way to find about food sensitivity, it is not costly as all you need is a blood pressure machine.</span></p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-GB\">•<span lang=\"en-CA\"> An Elimination Diet</span></h4>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">This is one of the most effective ways you can test your sensitivities. You do this test by eliminating the foods you suspect might be causing harm one by one and reintroducing them back to your diet <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/Gut-Repair-Dayana-Deschamps/dp/1980989451/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=dayana+deschamps&amp;qid=1559916990&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-2\">(I have outlined the simplest way to do it in my eBook here).</a> </span></p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">How to Fix the Problem?</span></h4>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2037\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2037\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-2037 size-full\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/canstockphoto37322651-1.jpg\" alt=\"Allergens\" width=\"800\" height=\"714\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/canstockphoto37322651-1.jpg 800w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/canstockphoto37322651-1-300x268.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/canstockphoto37322651-1-768x685.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2037\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">List of allergens</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1389 size-full\" src=\"https://lanaturolistica.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/canstockphoto37322651.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"714\" /></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">You can fix this problem by avoiding any suspected substance or food that might be causing your food allergies. The most common foods to watch for are:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Food additives</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Wheat and milk products</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Soy products</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Legumes</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Corn</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Citrus fruits</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Caffeine</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Chocolate</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Nightshades such as tomatoes</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Paprika</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Red pepper</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Potatoes</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Eggplant</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Cayenne</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Chili and tobacco</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Pineapple</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Bee pollen</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Shellfish</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">It is important to avoid such foods and support the gut with a healing program. That can help lower inflammation through diet and stress management.</span></p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Supplements to Protect the Gut Lining:</span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><a href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/dont-buy-another-probiotics-supplement-before-reading-this/\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Probiotics</span></a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Digestive enzymes</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">L glutamine</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Slippery elm</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Okra powder</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Beneficial Food</span></h4>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Bone broth is also beneficial as it contains lots of amino acids and collagen to assist in the healing process.</span></p>\n<h4 lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Essential Oils</span></h4>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span lang=\"en-CA\">Oregano oil is reported to help alleviate allergies.
