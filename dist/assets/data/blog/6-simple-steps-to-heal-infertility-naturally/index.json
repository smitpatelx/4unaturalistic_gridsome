What happens if that tick goes unanswered? Research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has it that millions of American women suffer from one form of infertility or the other. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least 7.5 million women between the ages of 15 and 44 have trouble conceiving or maintaining a pregnancy to full term. The implication is that there are lots of women who would love to get pregnant but cannot. Thankfully, there are lots of options that one can use that may be of help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In America and the world at large, the rate of infertility continues to be on the high side. Environmental toxins and pollution are possibly at blame.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h4> But the question is… what is infertility? </h4>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two definitions of this affliction:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Infertility is the inability to get pregnant despite engaging in frequent, unprotected sex for not less than a year. </li><li>On the secondary aspect, infertility may be defined as an inability to carry a pregnancy to term following the birth of at least one biological child.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Infertility is caused by many factors including:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>emotional stress, </li><li>poor nutrition, </li><li>thyroid disorders, </li><li>sexually transmitted diseases, </li><li>medical conditions, </li><li>candida, </li><li>too much exercise and stress, </li><li>as well as hormonal disorders; and fibroids and endometriosis;</li><li>and obesity, alcohol abuse, and smoking;</li><li>and environmental toxins such as endocrine disruptors.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it is relieving to note that many couples can and will conceive without treatment. This article will discuss in detail some science-proven ways of treating infertility naturally. With these, you and your partner can conceive sooner than you expect without undergoing financial stress or the stress of invasive fertility treatments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>So what are the steps one can take to heal infertility naturally?</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>An Anti-inflammatory Diet</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/brandless-jr6MR7FDvTc-unsplash-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2433\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/brandless-jr6MR7FDvTc-unsplash-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/brandless-jr6MR7FDvTc-unsplash-300x169.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/brandless-jr6MR7FDvTc-unsplash-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption> Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@brandless?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Brandless</a>  </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the most important options. Some foods help in the natural treatment of infertility. Among these include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Organic foods</strong>;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Pesticides can alter estrogen levels in the blood. It is therefore of utmost importance to select only organic products as much as you can. Foods cultivated via organic farming has little or no contact with pesticides. If pesticides are used, organic farming ensures that they come from natural products (devoid of tobacco dust or arsenic). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoid refined and processed foods as well as toxins such as colors, flavors, and MSG. Monosodium glutamate commonly referred to as MSG is present in many food staples; however many studies suggest that it can contribute to infertility</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Wild-caught fish is another natural healing diet that may be used;</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p> It is rich in omega-3s. It has anti-inflammatory properties and can enhance fertilization and implantation. Studies have shown that an Omega-3 rich diet helps in regulating ovulation, improves the quality of the ovum and delays ovary aging (3).</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Antioxidants rich Other foods;</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>They contain a lot of vitamin C, E, and folate; such as berries, green leafy, sprouts, nuts, and seeds. You can also add Cabbage, broccoli, brussels sprouts to your diet; as they can promote gut health.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Caffeine;</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It may trigger hormonal imbalances and dehydration, resulting in mineral deficiencies. Research has shown that high consumption of caffeine interferes with fertility. Reducing caffeine intake facilitates the conception process. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>According to the American Pregnancy Association, fertility can be reduced by 27% or more in individuals who consume more than 200 to 300 milligrams of caffeine daily.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>You can read more about how to start on an anti-inflammatory diet the right way in my article:&#8221; <a href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/how-to-start-on-the-anti-inflammatory-diet-simple-tips/\">How to Start on the Anti-Inflammatory Diet: Simple Tips&#8221;.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Stress reduction</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kike-vega-F2qh3yjz6Jk-unsplash-1024x646.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2406\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kike-vega-F2qh3yjz6Jk-unsplash-1024x646.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kike-vega-F2qh3yjz6Jk-unsplash-300x189.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kike-vega-F2qh3yjz6Jk-unsplash-768x484.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Photo by kike vega on Unsplash</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people take this for granted but stress reduction is an important factor to consider if you desire to do away with the infertility issue. The world we live in is highly mobile, and stress is on the rise, with its attendant impact on our health. It is of utmost importance that we fight hard against the negative impact of stress on our body systems. Studies have shown that stress impacts negatively on a woman’s fertility. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>The enzyme amylase and infertility.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A particular study investigated the concentration of an enzyme, alpha-amylase in the saliva of women who were attempting to get pregnant. This was done over a year. It was found out that of the 400 couples who participated in the study, 87 percent had no issue getting pregnant. After making adjustments for certain factors such as alcohol, age, caffeine, race, and cigarette use, the researchers discovered that women who had the highest concentration of amylase had their chances of getting pregnant reduced by about 29 percent, as opposed to women who had very low levels of the enzyme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try as much as you can to eliminate all stress factors from your life. Stress raises the level of cortisol which not only disturbs the reproductive system but also causes other physical and mental disorders.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Better Sleep</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes! Fertility may improve by getting adequate sleep.  Studies have shown that not having adequate sleep each night can impact negatively on one’s health and by extension, the ability to conceive. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The average woman (between 30 and 60 years of age) sleeps for at least six hours and 41 minutes each workweek. This is according to the National Sleep Foundation. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Sleep affects the hormonal system. If you fail to get an adequate amount of sleep, then your ovulatory cycle may be distorted. In the absence of sleep, leptin levels reduce drastically, impacting negatively on ovulation as well. Insomniacs and people with sleep disorders have higher levels of stress hormones which discourage fertility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Target at least 8 hours of sleep daily. Have some off time within the week to do things that give you joy. If you have difficulty sleeping, you can make use of natural sleep aids that equally work as a form of natural infertility treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Exercise – balances the hormonal system</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Engaging in exercise balances your hormonal levels. In many cases, people feel this but do not know what it is. You witness an improvement in your mood, sleep better and even have a raised libido. All these changes are associated with changes in hormonal levels. We are created and designed to lead an active life. However, many of us have adopted the sedentary style. If you desire to get pregnant, then it is of utmost importance that you exercise regularly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Exercise plan</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/heather-ford-hthsAhksQ5M-unsplash-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2434\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/heather-ford-hthsAhksQ5M-unsplash-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/heather-ford-hthsAhksQ5M-unsplash-150x150.jpg 150w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/heather-ford-hthsAhksQ5M-unsplash-300x300.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/heather-ford-hthsAhksQ5M-unsplash-768x768.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption> Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@the_modern_life_mrs?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Heather Ford</a> </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The hormones are involved in every step of the way – from ovulation to fertilization. Effective balancing of the hormones can be achieved via burst training and weight training. With consistent exercise, one can also achieve a healthy waistline which boosts one’s chances of conceiving. However, this doesn’t mean one should engage in excessively strenuous exercises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research has shown that working out too hard can cause hormonal problems and issues with fertility. Researchers have also found that an extremely high or low level of physical activity has negative effects on fertility.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Chiropractic care</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Not many women would consider going to the chiropractor while they are pregnant. However, studies have shown that it may be vital to current infertility issues across the globe. Chiropractic care deals with the wellness of the entire body. No system is left out. Speaking of fertility, chiropractic care can make positive differences in many persons. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Research by the International Chiropractic Pediatric Association has shown that misalignment in the spine can impact nerve signals. Inhibition of neural signals can impact negatively in the pituitary gland as well as the hypothalamus, resulting in hormonal issues that may ultimately lead to infertility issues. It is therefore important that your spine is in health to have a functioning reproductive system (8). </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h4>Essential oils</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a couple of essential that are helpful to help infertility. Among these include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>ylang-ylang;</li><li>Roman chamomile may assist in infertility treatment in women; </li><li>while sandalwood;</li><li>and thyme may assist in men.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>My article:<a href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/what-to-know-when-buying-essential-oils_-myth-vs-reality/\"> &#8220;What to Know When Buying Essential Oils_ Myth vs Reality&#8221;.</a> Contain great information about how to buy essential oils. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Herbal and supplements</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Some herbal remedies may help alleviate infertility such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>velvet deer antler; commonly used by Chinese practitioners;</li><li>Peruvian maca;</li><li>vitamin B6 and PABA.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Final thoughts?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Infertility issues are something many do not wish for. With the rising rates of infertility, we must search for and adopt natural treatment methods. This is of great benefit as conventional treatment and surgery are of high costs and can take a physical toll on both the pregnant mother and the fetus.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Caution:</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Talk to your doctor or holistic practitioner to find out medical solutions that can work specifically for you. Do not try to treat infertility on your won without a professional opinion.
