Today, people are suffering from illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disorders, cancers; and other inflammatory ailments. People living in industrialized countries are especially prone to such illnesses and often die from various cancers.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Many studies today have shown that lifestyle choices, especially the foods that we consume every day, can greatly impact the rate of illnesses. A well-balanced diet can help fight many of the illnesses that people face every day. Some of these foods have anti-inflammatory compounds, which can deter the body from such diseases.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As a result, avoiding inflammatory promoting foods and consuming more natural anti-inflammatory foods can greatly reduce the number of illnesses. It&#8217;s time to create the perfect anti-inflammatory shopping list with this ultimate guide.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Organic versus non-organic food</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Before you start buying food, it is important to understand organic and non-organic foods. It does not matter if the foods are fresh, or frozen. Organic is completely natural and fresh and gives you all the benefits of the nutrients without the harmful extras. What organic food does not contain:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It does not contain additives;</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">chemicals;</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">antibiotics;</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and pesticides.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There are no harmful toxins that affect your body. The only disadvantage of organic is more expensive. Whereas conventionally grown foods contain all of the above.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">However, you can keep the costs down. It may be worthwhile visiting a farmers market. Talk to the farmers to find out what types of chemicals or preservatives they use in their vegetables and fruits. You can also shop by the &#8220;Dirty Dozen and the Clean Fifteen&#8221; shopping list.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Mediterranean Food</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">One of the best diets for an anti-inflammatory diet is the Mediterranean Diet. This includes foods that are full of antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids. These types of nutrients are elements that reduce inflammation in the body. They send the right signals to the immune system; supporting it and preventing healthy body elements from being attacked.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants also help protect the cells. Cells naturally die or become damaged over time. If you get the right nutrition, you can prevent free radicals from invading and cell structure as the cells repair and regrow.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Another big advantage of the Mediterranean diet is the departure from processed junk food. The Mediterranean diet is all about healthy and natural foods.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8220;Eating a Mediterranean-style diet has been linked to several health benefits, including prevention and/or reversal of metabolic syndrome, a cluster of risk factors for heart disease and diabetes,&#8221; writes Dr. Joseph Mercola in his article: </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2017/01/16/why-the-mediterranean-diet-is-so-successful.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Why the Mediterranean Diet is so Successful.</span></a></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The perfect anti-inflammatory shopping list</span></h4>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2174\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2174\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2174\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/jessica-lewis-FVbZZpP58dY-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/jessica-lewis-FVbZZpP58dY-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/jessica-lewis-FVbZZpP58dY-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/jessica-lewis-FVbZZpP58dY-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2174\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Jessica Lewis on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Here is the grocery list you want to consider to fight inflammation in your body. Add more of these delicious, natural anti-inflammatory foods to your diet to promote healthy habits in yourself and your family:</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Vegetables and fruits</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Veggies and fruits of green and bright colors help the process of inflammatory conditions. Vegetables and fruits are rich in antioxidants such as vitamins, minerals, fiber which the body needs every day to stay healthy.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There are many varieties, for example, squash, sweet potatoes, avocados, lentils, dark green leafy vegetables, and cruciferous vegetables. All of these have many antioxidants, phytochemicals and anti-inflammatory properties present.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Important Fats</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Also rich in anti-inflammatory foods are olive oil, coconut oil, grass-fed butter, salmon, and sardines, and avocados. Most contain omega 3 fatty acids which are essential for inflammation and joint health.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The acid from omega 3 is an inflammatory agent that changes into prostaglandins which is a hormone-like substance. Omega 3 is not only beneficial for joint pain and inflammation, but it is also important for health in general.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">We can get a lot of omega from our diet; by including some of the healthy oils such as:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">olive,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">coconut,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">macadamia,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and krill, which is stronger than fish oil.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There are many options of foods available that contain a variety of omega. If you are not lactose intolerant, then you can also eat cheese that is mainly from sheep and goats milk &#8211; such as feta.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Choose the Right Oil</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Olive oil has more health benefits than most people realize. Make sure to use it in your diet as much as possible. Olive oil is high in antioxidants and is containing a substance called oleuropein.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Medical science has discovered that extra virgin olive oil is one of the healthiest foods we can add to our diet. This oil is most helpful and effective for arthritis sufferers because it can cool inflammation and ease joint pain.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">However, cooking, frying, baking, etc. use only coconut or macadamia nut oil. Other oils when heated become toxic and usually turn into trans fats which can trigger inflammation and joint pain, as well as other health issues.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Avoid these oils:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Vegetable oils,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">soybean,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and canola.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">These are the more common ones most people know about because of their names. Yes, they have a healthy sounding name, but they are not healthy.

As well turmeric has compound curcumin which is known for many health benefits and has the power to cure joint pain. It is best used in its natural powder form and added to your diet when possible, the more the better.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Other important spices used for reducing inflammation are cinnamon, rosemary, garlic, ginger, coriander, cumin, and caraway and oregano. These are high in polyphenols and bioflavonoids which help to reduce inflammation as well as fight off free radicals.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Cayenne pepper is also known for its anti-inflammatory property and its capsicum content which is added to some creams for pain relief.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Grains, Nuts, and Seeds</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you don&#8217;t have any food </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/the-truth-about-food-sensitivity-how-to-protect-your-gut/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">sensitivities</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> or intolerance, and/ or a </span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/how-to-know-if-you-have-leaky-gut-supplements-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">leaky gut</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, consider eating whole grains. Whole grains that contain complex carbohydrates can also help in preventing spikes in the sugar level of the blood. As it is known that sugar promotes inflammation.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">However, use only unrefined whole grains, once processing has taken place all the goodness is lost, such as vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Among the best grains are oats:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Whole oats,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Kamut,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">quinoa,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">couscous,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and Bulgar.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You can also add seeds to your diet. The best seeds are:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">chia,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">flaxseed,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">pumpkin</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and hemp seeds.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Don&#8217;t forget nuts; which contain lots of nutrients and good fats to boost brain health such as:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">almonds,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">hazelnuts,</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and pine nuts.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Vitamins and minerals are an incredible part of protecting the good fats from getting rancid. So, taking an antioxidant synergy or a multivitamin is of great benefit. It can fill the spot of some foods you otherwise may not get from your diet as needed daily.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">However, your priority must always be a healthy clean diet. Only then, when taking a supplement you will get the best value.</span></p>\n<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Top 5 Benefits of Following the Mediterranean Diet:</span></h4>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2177\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2177\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2177\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/gesina-kunkel-IP0Y3axkpJE-unsplash-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/gesina-kunkel-IP0Y3axkpJE-unsplash-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/gesina-kunkel-IP0Y3axkpJE-unsplash-300x225.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/gesina-kunkel-IP0Y3axkpJE-unsplash-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2177\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Gesina Kunkel on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Good Heart Health</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">While following a Mediterranean diet each anti-inflammatory recipe help promoting good heart health.
