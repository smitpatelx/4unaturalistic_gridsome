It can be performed at least once a year followed by a health maintenance routine to ensure overall wellbeing.</p>\n<p>A colon cleanse allows the healing of certain sensitive tissue in order to do its work; while increasing the liver production of bile and secretions from the glands of the intestinal tract.</p>\n<h4>The four major colons cleanse:</h4>\n<h3>Enemas</h3>\n<p>An enema is used in the early stages of constipation; enemas are inserted through the rectum. They effectively remove the materials clogged in the rectum or lower part of the colon. There are mainly three types of Enemas: water enemas, coffee enemas, and clay enemas.</p>\n<h4>Colon hydrotherapy or colonics</h4>\n<p>It is a procedure that involves introducing warm water into the colon with the help of a disposable plastic tube that is inserted through the anus. The water cleanses the colon and flushes back removing all the toxins.</p>\n<h4>Oxygen Colon Cleansers</h4>\n<p>This product can help to remove compacted wastes from the colon through an oxidation-reduction activity and the waste materials are get rid of in form of gas and water.</p>\n<h4>Herbal Cleansers</h4>\n<p>These colon cleansing products are based on a combination of herbs such as Goldenseal, Apple Pectin, cascara sagrada, slippery elm, and Aloe Vera, digestive enzymes and probiotics (each company has a different formula though).
