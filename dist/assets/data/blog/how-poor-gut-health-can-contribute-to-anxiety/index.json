This belief has been in existence for more than a hundred years – which gut health affects one’s mood in some way. The relationship between gut health and mental health was brought to limelight by scientists and researchers in the early 1900s. However, in the 1930s, there was a reversal of opinions, and scientists adopted the views that mental health issues contributed to gastrointestinal disorders.</p>\n<p>Never in history has science showed such interest between the gut and mental health. Studies of the gut microbiota have shown a relationship between mood, behavior, and bacterial imbalance. The gut environment and gut microbiota are under the influence of so many factors including diet. There is also a close relationship with the immune system health.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h4><strong>What link does the gut have with the brain?</strong></h4>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2420\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2420\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-2420 size-large\" title=\"Brain health\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/alina-grubnyak-tEVGmMaPFXk-unsplash-1024x819.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"819\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/alina-grubnyak-tEVGmMaPFXk-unsplash-1024x819.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/alina-grubnyak-tEVGmMaPFXk-unsplash-300x240.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/alina-grubnyak-tEVGmMaPFXk-unsplash-768x614.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2420\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Alina Grubnyak on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-428 size-large\" src=\"https://lanaturolistica.blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jesse-orrico-60373-unsplash-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"429\" />The vagus nerve, gut-brain axis, and the enteric nervous system link the brain with the gut. The vagus nerve originates from the brain stem and runs through the neck, thorax, and the abdomen. Passing through rootlets in the medulla, it exits the brainstem. These rootlets lie caudal to the rootlets for the ninth cranial nerve. The vagus nerve is actually a parasympathetic nerve and plays a vital role in the regulation of speech, heart rate, activities in the gastrointestinal tract, and sweating.</p>\n<p>The enteric nervous system is linked to the central nervous system. It has about 600 million neurons. Mechanical activities taking place in the gut wall are monitored by sensory neurons of the enteric nervous system. This information is then integrated into local circuit neurons. This allows motor neurons to influence the activities of smooth muscles in the wall of the gut and also modulate glandular secretions such as stomach acid, bile, mucus, and digestive enzymes.</p>\n<p>Science refers to the enteric nervous system as the second brain because it has the ability to work autonomously and senses signals to the central nervous system via the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.</p>\n<h4>How does poor gut health affect anxiety?</h4>\n<h4>The role of gut bacteria</h4>\n<p>Studies have shown that gut microbiota strongly influences brain chemistry and behavior. For instance, patients of irritable bowel syndrome, who also experience abdominal pain, cramping, constipation, gas, bloating and diarrhea, do experience some form of anxiety and depression.</p>\n<p>There is a two-way interaction between anxiety and depression, and bacteria<span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">. </span></span><a href=\"https://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/link-between-depression-anxiety-and-gut-health/\">In a 2009 study</a>, for instance, male pup rats underwent some form of stress as they were separated from their mothers, which led to an alteration in their gut microbiota. Though the pups were separated for just 11 days, and three hours each day, researchers agreed that such adverse events might have a negative impact on their lives in later years – they were at risk of having such diseases as depression, and irritable bowel syndrome.</p>\n<h4>Dopamine and serotonin link</h4>\n<p>Gut microbiota has a strong influence on the production of dopamine and serotonin. Frankly, 90 percent of the serotonin produced in the body is present in the gut. Serotonin plays a vital role in the regulation of gastrointestinal motility. It also falls among the class of “feel-good” neurotransmitters and gives one the feeling of happiness and satisfaction. As a matter of fact, the gastrointestinal system uses no less than thirty neurotransmitters, including dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A 2004 study found that when depressed rats were given some strains of probiotics, it resulted in a positive immune response and a reversal of behavioral disorders. In instances such as this, it appears that the use of probiotics may have a positive, or more appropriately, a therapeutic effect on symptoms of anxiety and depression.</p></blockquote>\n<h4>Restoring the gut flora</h4>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2242\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2242\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-2242 size-full\" title=\"Probiotics and gut health\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/canstockphoto23464192-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/canstockphoto23464192-3.jpg 800w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/canstockphoto23464192-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/canstockphoto23464192-3-768x513.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2242\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dusan</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>The health of the gastrointestinal tract can be maintained by adopting a healthy diet. Such diets should be based on fruits and vegetables. <a href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/fermented-cashew-cheese-your-own-homemade-batch/\">Fermented foods</a> such as yogurt and kefir can be added to the diet – as a natural source of probiotics.</p>\n<p>If you are not used to taking probiotic foods, you may take a high-strain probiotic supplement like <a href=\"https://store.draxe.com/collections/ancient-probiotics/products/ancient-probiotics-womens-once-daily\">Ancient probiotics</a>, which is loaded with probiotics and helps keep the gut environment healthy.</p>\n<h4>Natural ways to beat anxiety</h4>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-430 size-large\" src=\"https://lanaturolistica.blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/fabian-moller-401625-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"432\" />If you find yourself getting depressed consistently, then you have to visit your physician. That’s the best port of call. He or she will give you the right advice on a treatment regimen that will suit your needs. However, there are natural ways that one may use to combat <a href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/top-4-health-issues-that-contributed-to-my-anxiety-attacks/\">anxiety.</a> These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>Avoiding caffeine</h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Caffeine is a stimulant. It raises the level of adrenaline in the blood; and as a depressed or anxious person, adrenaline is the hormone to beat. It is best to stay away from colas, coffee, chocolate, and guarana and restrict your tea intake to just two cups daily.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>Take in small meals frequently</h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The key to keeping your mood stable is optimizing your blood sugar levels. Take in small meals every 2-3 hours. These meals should have good protein content. For instance, you may take some almonds, lettuce and boiled egg, brown rice and a can of tuna.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>Breathe in</h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anxiety results in shallow breathing. Try to prolong your breath, allowing the breath to get deeper into the abdomen. Count to three while inhaling, and then release on the fourth.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>Communicate with yourself</h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Say positive things to yourself. Make affirmations – self-affirming and positive messages to one’s self. To combat anxiety, you need a calm and positive atmosphere. You can say the following to yourself – “I’m equal to the task, all will be well.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>Discuss with a caring friend or relation</h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2419\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2419\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-2419 size-large\" title=\"Call a friend\" src=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dustin-belt-lg4fM9Y2pGg-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dustin-belt-lg4fM9Y2pGg-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dustin-belt-lg4fM9Y2pGg-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://4unaturalistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dustin-belt-lg4fM9Y2pGg-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2419\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Dustin Belt on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Talking to someone who cares or listens can help reduce s<a href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/top-4-health-issues-that-contributed-to-my-anxiety-attacks/\">tress levels</a> and anxiety.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>Try cocooning</h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you feel completely overwhelmed, place your both palms gently on your face (in a side-by-side position). Allow your fingers to rest gently on your eyelids (which must be closed). This will center you, allowing you some time to quiet the mind until you are ready to face the world once more.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>Try getting your mind off the problem</h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Distract the negative thoughts with positive ones. You can try some extra-curricular activities such as yoga, meditation or taking the dog for a walk.</p>\n<blockquote><p>You can draw some inspiration from own story: <a href=\"https://4unaturalistic.com/top-4-health-issues-that-contributed-to-my-anxiety-attacks/\">Top 4 Health Issues that Contributed to My Anxiety Attacks</a></p></blockquote>\n<h4>Caution</h4>\n<p>This article is for educational purposes only.</p>\n<h4>Reference:</h4>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li>Alison C Bested, Alan C Logan, Eva M Selhub. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3601973/\">Intestinal microbiota, probiotics and mental health: from Metchinikoff to modern advances: Part II – contemporary contextual.</a> Gut Pathog. 2013; 5.</li>\n<li>Dash S, Clarke G, Berk M, Jacka FN. <a style=\"font-size: inherit;\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25415497\">The gut microbiome and diet in psychiatry: focus on depression.</a><span style=\"font-size: inherit;\"> Current Opinion in Psychiatry. 2015 Jan: 28(1):1-6.</span></li>\n<li>Dinan TG, Cryan JF. <a style=\"font-size: inherit;\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23910373\">Melancholic microbes: a link between gut microbiota and depression?</a><span style=\"font-size: inherit;\"> Neurogastroenterology and Motility. 2013 September.</span></li>\n<li>Forsythe P, Bienenstock J, Kunze WA. <a style=\"font-size: inherit;\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24997031\">Vagal pathways for microbiome-brain-gut-axis communication.</a><span style=\"font-size: inherit;\"> Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology. 2014.</span></li>\n<li>Furness JB, Callaghan BP, Rivera LR, Cho HJ. <a style=\"font-size: inherit;\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24997029\">The enteric nervous system and gastrointestinal innervation: integrated local and central control.</a><span style=\"font-size: inherit;\"> Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology. 2014;817:39-71.</span></li>\n<li>LOYOLA UNIVERSITY CHICAGO HEALTH SCIENCES DIVISION.
